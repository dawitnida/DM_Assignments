Q3.e
Because the age data is not symmetrical

Q4.a


insulin is most strongly corelated with plasma glucose

Blood pressure and age have average corelation.

Q5a2. Blood pressure has relatively the least cause diabetes, on the other hand plasma glucose, and age seems like to have a relationship with diabetes. Which is, acording to the graph younger people seems to have less number of diabets than the older ones, and high glucose concentration can be the symptom for diabetes.
