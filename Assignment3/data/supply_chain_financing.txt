Supply chain financing . The invention describes a method for financing and/or valuing participants in a supply chain. By aggregating borrowing needs of the supply chain, an individual participant in that supply chain may be able to obtain more favorable financing than if the borrower sought financing alone. This financing method may include credit scoring, credit enhancement techniques, and asset-backed securitization. A larger/stronger participant in the supply chain, which may even be the original equipment manufacturer itself, may support credit enhancement techniques. In return for such support, that larger/stronger participant may receive financial advantages and/or information as to how the participants operate and thereby be able to assist in managing the chain as a whole in a more efficient manner and thereby provide benefits to all participants in that chain.
