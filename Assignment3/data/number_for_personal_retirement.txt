Number for personal retirement . The object of the invention is to calcuate how much money may be spent per year from a retirement account over a client defined retirement period. The invention calculates a withdrawal amount or number or THE NUMBER FOR PERSONAL RETIREMENT. THE NUMBER is calculated from a complex formula using a hypothetical withdrawal amount compared to a remainer. When the absolute value of the remainder is less than the withdrawal amount, the withdrawal amount is correct within a range of answers. The range of answers is most accurate as the remainder diminishes to zero. A distribution ratio may be calculated by dividing the withdrawal amount by the account starting value. Amazingly, when the distribution ratio is found for one account, the same distribution ratio is equally accurate for all other accounts of the client for a duration for example one year. A printed report by year proves THE NUMBER works.
