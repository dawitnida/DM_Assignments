Transaction authentication over independent network . A method of authenticating an online transaction over a first network uses 2-factor authentication of the user to defeat hacker attacks. A communication device is registered for use with the method. The communication device is configured to receive messages over a second network independent of the first network. The user is authenticated over the first network using a first factor, such as a username and password, and then initiates the transaction. A request to execute the transaction is received and a one-time password is obtained to be used as a second factor of authentication. The one-time password and details describing the transaction are sent to the communication device over the second network. The one-time password is received from the user over the first network to complete the second factor of authentication.
