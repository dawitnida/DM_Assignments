Techniques For Targeted Offers . Systems and methods for analyzing and segregating payment card account profiles into clusters and targeting offers to cardholders. Offers may be targeted based on analyzing customer transactions with merchants from a merchant category as compared with transactions with merchants from a universe of merchants. Customers who have no transaction history with a merchant may be selected for offers based on similarities with respect to other customers of the merchant. Multiple merchant offers may be combined into a single mailing based on a scoring algorithm.
