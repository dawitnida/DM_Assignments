Receiving bid requests and pricing bid responses for potential grid job submissions within a grid environment . A computer-implemented method, system, and program for receiving bid requests and pricing bid responses for potential grid job submissions within a grid environment are provided. The grid environment includes multiple grid resource nodes available for executing a grid job at a price. Clients submit bid requests for potential grid job submissions to a bid request portal of the grid environment. A workload factor is calculated for each bid request that indicates the estimated resource usage at a resource work unit level for the potential grid job. Next, a cost calculator calculates a price for the potential grid job submission based on the predicted workload factor and a cost per granular work unit, such that the price is available for an automated response to the bid request. The cost per resource work unit may be calculated based on the current and predicted workload on the resources available in the grid environment. Pricing may also be adjusted by available discounting or contractual pricing restraints.
