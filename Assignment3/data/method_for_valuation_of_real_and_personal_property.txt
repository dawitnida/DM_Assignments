Method for valuation of real and personal property . A method for assessing differences in value distributions of real property and personal property coverage at an insured's site comprising collecting information on the amount of insurance coverage from various sources to provide a database and using the database information to create a distribution of values for the building and contents for each occupancy. A reference distribution is created for value of the building and contents for an occupancy based upon assessments of similar buildings and contents. The value distributions based upon the customer supplied valuation data are compared with reference distributions for the same occupancy and a report is generated which includes an assessment of the deviation of the customer contents value distribution from the reference distribution.
