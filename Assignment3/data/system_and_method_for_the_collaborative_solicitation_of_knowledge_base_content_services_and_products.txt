SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE COLLABORATIVE SOLICITATION OF KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTENT, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS . A system and method for soliciting a content item, which may include but is not limited to one or more products, services and/or acts, based on an assumption that if a content item can be identified for which a single Internet user has a desire, amongst the millions of world-wide Internet users, there is likely a similar desire among many hundreds or even thousands of Internet users. Even if a content item has not been provided and/or produced, and/or has not been posted to the Internet, the approach assumes that among the millions of Internet users, at least one user has the knowledge and/or skill to produce and/or provide the desired content item, and that by collaboratively grouping relatively nominal sums from a large number of interested Internet users, an individual and/or group of individuals may be sufficiently economically motivated to produce and/or provide and/or post the content item.
