Systems and methods for transaction triggered cycling of financial accounts . Systems and methods are provided for setting a cycle date for a financial account. For instance, a cycling module may be provided to set a default cycle date for cycling the financial account, and an account monitoring module may be provided to determine whether a transaction is posted on the financial account within a first predetermined period before the default cycle date. If a transaction is posted on the financial account within the first predetermined period, then the cycling module sets a new cycle date. The new cycle date can be set to a date that follows the transaction post date by a second predetermined period. Alternatively, the new cycle date may be set to other dates, such as a date corresponding to the next qualifying date.
