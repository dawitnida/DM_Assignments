Electronic trading system with market-centered display and dynamic price tracking . A system for electronic trading enables users to trade financial instruments by displaying information relating to financial instruments in a market-centered manner, tracking user selections of price and quantity of contracts for the financial instrument, and initiating placement of a user-specified order as the market changes. The system includes a user system that communicates market information to a user via a display. The display includes a price column for dynamically communicating market prices and an order area. The order area includes indicators that identify the prices in the price column representing the market, and order selection blocks that enable a user to identify a price and/or quantity for tracking or for placing an order. Once identified, the system tracks the price and quantity as the price changes with the market so that a user may command the system to initiate placement of an order for the identified price and quantity.
