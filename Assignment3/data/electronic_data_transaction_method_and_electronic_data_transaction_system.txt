Electronic data transaction method and electronic data transaction system . An electronic data transaction system for onerously transferring copyright-protected electronic data (intangible form) without allowing the user to duplicate the data. The system resells the received electronic data to another consumer at a price lower than the regular price. This reselling system heightens the market awareness of consumers, provides return for the copyright owners from two sources, helps build a business model based on the market competition mechanism, and contributes to reduction of the price of electronic data and to expansion of the electronic data trading market (FIG. 1).
