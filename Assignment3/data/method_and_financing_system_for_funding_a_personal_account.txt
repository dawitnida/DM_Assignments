Method and financing system for funding a personal account . A method of funding a personal savings account is accomplished by a donor selecting a personal account to be funded, the donor using a financial instrument which generates an embedded fee or an awards or loyalty program, and directing a portion of the embedded fee or awards program into the donor-designated account. A sub-account is established in the financial instrument for receipt of all or a portion of the fee or program value before disbursement into the savings account. Additional portions of the embedded fee or awards programs may be directed to a liaison, advisor, and/or administrator. A personal savings account may be a health account, retirement account, education account, or charitable account for the benefit and/or use of the donor or a third party. A method of systematically linking investing with directing of funds from the investment by designing a fee structure within the investment whereby part of the fee is credited into a sub-account.
