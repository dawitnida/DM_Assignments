Distribution Of Financial Instruments Among Counterparties . A computer implemented method and system is provided for distributing aggregated financial instruments among counterparties. The counterparties' financial instrument positions are acquired along with risk measures. The financial instrument positions are weighted using the risk measures to obtain risk weighted positions. An aggregate risk is computed by aggregating the risk weighted positions of the financial instruments. A position risk is computed by aggregating the risk weighted positions of the counterparties. A financial instrument with highest aggregate risk is allocated to a counterparty with highest position risk based on predefined rules. The position risks are recomputed by aggregating the risk weighted positions modified due to the allocation. An unallocated financial instrument with highest aggregate risk is allocated to a counterparty with highest change in position risk after the recomputation. Recomputation of the position risk and allocation of the unallocated financial instruments are performed until the financial instruments are completely allocated.
