"HIERARCHICALLY APPLIED RULES ENGINE (""HARE"") ". An electronic transaction decision module is provided that includes a dynamic rules engine, processing system and interfaces to enable various participants in an electronic payment environment to establish and modify the rules, condition values, fees and rewards associated with electronic transactions. Participants in electronic financial or other economic transactions are authorized and enabled to define multiple rules, condition values, fees and rewards within which they either authorize or deny the consummation of a financial transaction and define its impact upon various participants, and to dynamically and efficiently modify those rules, condition values, fees and rewards when desired. Rules, condition values, fees and rewards may be set and evaluated hierarchically based on the participant's relative authority with respect to each attribute. Embodiments of the invention enable the rapid deployment and real-time management of card and mobile payment programs and provide access to card program functions not only by card issuers and program managers, but also by individual cardholders.
