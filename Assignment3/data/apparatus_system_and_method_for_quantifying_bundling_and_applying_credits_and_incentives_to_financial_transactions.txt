Apparatus, System, and Method for Quantifying Bundling, and Applying Credits and Incentives to Financial Transactions . An apparatus, system, and method for quantifying, aggregating and bundling green incentives based on green construction enables applying at least a portion of the credits/incentives to financial transactions. Quantification includes estimating and/or monitoring usage of utilities, comparing the usage to a predetermined baseline value, and valuating an effectual energy savings that includes actual savings plus incentive values. Quantification relies on a database, which may include credits, deductions, and other green incentives data that contribute to the effectual savings. The effectual savings may be applied to early repayment of a mortgage loan, improved terms for the loan, investment in securities, and/or other trading. The method standardizes values of green incentives in energy units and/or monetary units. The method aids in qualifying the building projects based on a concrete estimation of the effectual energy savings. The method forms a bridge between green or sustainable/renewable technologies and the financial institutions and markets.
