Method and apparatus for verifying financial account information . An apparatus and method for verifying a customer's financial information is disclosed wherein a seller accepts information about the details of price and quantity of the goods to be purchased, and accepts information about customer's financial account. Payment is authorized for desired goods in two or more separate transactions, the amount of each transaction totaling the total price of the goods. Then the amount of each transaction is received from the customer and compared to the amount charged to the bank. If the two amounts match then the goods are shipped to the customer and payment is settled. In an alternative embodiment a ratio of the two amounts received from the customer is used rather than the amounts themselves to compensate for currency variations.
