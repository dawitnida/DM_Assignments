Parallel availability control checks in financial management system . A rule set for an AVC system permits AVC operations to be performed at various levels of hierarchy within a governing budget data structure. A rule set contains a plurality of rules, each having an address field which relates an arbitrarily assigned control object to budget nodes in a budget data structure. Control objects typically are assigned to various units and aggregation levels within an organization and also across other dimensions. Rule arrays with several independent rule sets can be activated in parallel for checking an individual input data record against multiple budgetary requirements defined for the organization. This structure provides a comprehensive AVC control feature even for very large budget data structures and complex budgetary control environments.
