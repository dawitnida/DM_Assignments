INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD AND ELECTRONIC MONEY SYSTEM . The present invention relates to an information processing method and an electronic money system that achieve contribution to the realization of a global or social objective, such as protection of global environment, by using the characteristics of electronic money, which is money, a point, or a right of use represented by electronic data. When an electronic money card 10 is presented to an electronic money interface 27, a controller 24 detects, by using a use/use status detection unit 31, the use of the electronic money card 10 and the time and place at which the electronic money card 10 is used. In a case where the use or the like is in line with an objective such as protection of global environment or social contribution because the use is purchase or use of a commercial product or a service which meets certain conditions and for which saving of resources or energy is achieved, the controller 24 performs processing for increasing the value of electronic money. Increasing the value is making a discount, increasing the balance, providing a point, or increasing a range in which the right of use can be granted.
