Processing data calls from wireless handsets to information nodes . In an exemplary method, a data call origination request containing a URL of the destination web server is received from a wireless handset supported by a mobility service provider at a switching node of the telecommunication network. A determination is made if the owner of the destination web server has agreed to pay for at least a portion of the telecommunication service charge by the mobility service provider for providing wireless access to the wireless handset for the data call. If the owner of the destination web server has agreed to pay for at least a portion of the telecommunication service charge by the mobility service provider, a call detail record associated with the data call is generated that contains information indicating that the owner of the destination web server will be responsible for at least the portion of the telecommunication service charge by the mobility service provider. The data call is then completed allowing packets originated by the wireless handset to be transmitted to the destination web server.
