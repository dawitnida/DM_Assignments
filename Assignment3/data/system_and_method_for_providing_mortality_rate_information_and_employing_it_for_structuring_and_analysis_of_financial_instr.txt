System and method for providing mortality rate information and employing it for structuring and analysis of financial instruments . The invention provides methods of extrapolating at least one future mortality rate by calculating a current year mortality rate for a particular age cohort, and applying a series of improvement factors to the current year mortality rate. The invention further provides methods of structuring a derivative financial instrument by providing projected going-forward mortality rates reflective of a degree of improvement in mortality rate experience for particular age cohorts for a particular future period, and defining settlement parameters wherein a value recognized by an investor in said instrument at the time of settlement relates at least in part to the correlation between said projected mortality rate and actually-incurred mortality rate for the age cohort during at least a portion of the period.
