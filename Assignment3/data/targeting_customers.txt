Targeting customers . Identifying customers interested in a product involves identifying the attributes of the product and aggregating fuzzy sets associated with each of the identified product attributes. Any attribute for which one can estimate the interest of customers, such as tangible and non-tangible product attributes, can be used to determine customer interest. Conversely, customer attributes can be used to predict products in which customers are likely to be interested. Thus, a unified approach for linking both customer and product spaces through customer characteristics and product attributes is described.
