Prioritizing Opportunities for Clinical Process Improvement . Systems and methods are provided for analyzing opportunities for optimizing clinical processes within clinical facilities. An optimized practice process model may be defined for a particular clinical procedure, setting forth an optimal clinical process. In addition, critical levers may be identified within the optimal clinical process, representing the activities that have the greatest impact on outcomes. The optimized practice process model may also include metrics for quantifying return-on-investments for various opportunities. Clinical facilities may collect clinically-related data, such as current measures for the critical levers. Using the clinically-related data and the optimized practice process model, opportunities for process optimization may be analyzed, for example, by determining a return-on-investment for the various opportunities.
