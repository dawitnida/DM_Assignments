Financial data analysis tool . "A method and system allowing a user to interrogate external financial data quickly and efficiently and to drill up or drill down and across multiple graphical displays (""maps"") of information. Maps offer multiple dimensional filtration functionality enabling a comparison between different investment strategies. External financial data is received and calculations can be performed on the external financial data to generate one or more indicators. Internal financial data is calculated from one or more of the external financial data and the indicators. Filters are applied to the external and internal financial data, and the indicators. The filtered data is used to generate maps of certain data usually plotted against external and internal financial data or indicators. Icons are generated adding another dimension to the map without adding an additional axis of data. Further ""depth"" to a map can be added by generating a sub-map or a historical movement map."
