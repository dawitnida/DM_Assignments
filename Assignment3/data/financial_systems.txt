Financial Systems . A method and system (1) for incorporating legacy systems in a service oriented architecture (SOA) includes decoupling legacy system business services from legacy system data services by creating, from the legacy system business services and data services, a set of (e.g. Java WebSphere.RTM.) SOA business services (5a-5c) for transactions and (e.g. DB2) stored procedures (7a-7d) for SOA data services. The business services are constructed from one or more data services and the transactional integrity of the transaction is maintained, in use. The stored procedures may be written to a transaction log and a check made to verify that all of the stored procedures from which the business service is constructed have been written to the log.
