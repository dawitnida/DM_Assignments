Account opening facilitation system, method and computer program product . A system for facilitating the opening of accounts by a plurality of backend systems. The account opening system includes a front-end interface that interacts with a customer to collect customer information such as an account-type selection, billing information and pickup location information. A backend interface of the system pre-validates the customer information and routes the customer information to the backend systems for activation of the account. The backend interface also includes a monitor that determines the availability of the backend systems and a cache that stores the open account request and customer information for later routing when the backend systems are temporarily unavailable. Advantageously, pre-validation of the customer information allows the backend interface to distribute an account number to the customer in real time when the backend systems are unavailable. Pre-validation ensures that the customer information is sufficiently correct to allow later activation of the account by the backend systems.
