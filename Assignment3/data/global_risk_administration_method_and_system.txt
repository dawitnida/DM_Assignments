Global Risk Administration Method and System . Embodiments of a Global Risk Administration (GRA) method and system include a GRA tool that assists an institution with various decision making processes by enabling the institution to customize the GRA tool to generate decisions based on information input by the institution or a customer of the institution. The GRA tool further accesses third party data sources for the purpose of verifying information and gathering additional information to be used in generating decisions. The data sources are selectable by the institution as an aspect of the customization in an embodiment. In an embodiment, the institution is a financial institution (FI), and customizing the GRA tool involves an FI user assigning attribution rules using, wherein attribution rules comprise characteristics of applicants for financial accounts. The user further creates one or more decision classes using the UI, wherein one or more attribution rules place an applicant in a decision class; and the user creates business rules, wherein a business rule determines a manner in which the GRA module interprets data from the third party data sources.
