System and method for identification, detection and investigation of maleficent acts . The invention relates to enterprise software for enabling organizations to apply business intelligence in an operational environment by integrating real-time transactional data with remote and disparate historical data to achieve true enterprise intelligence for maleficent activity detection, such as fraud and threat detection. It enables a workflow process comprising classification of data in remote disparate databases for identity verification, arbitration of fuzzy differences between data sets for detection of maleficent acts, and investigation of relationships between people, places and events using refined search techniques, analytical tools and visualization methods. The invention receives, verifies and classifies transaction datasets into predefined categories, enables detection and arbitration of ambiguities in the datasets, investigates high risk datasets, enables transaction datasets in a low risk category and disables transaction datasets in a high risk category. Remote similarity search agents are used to search disparate databases to ensure privacy of the information in the disparate databases.
