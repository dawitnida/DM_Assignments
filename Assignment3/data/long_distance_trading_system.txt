Long distance trading system . The invention relates to a long distance trading system for carrying out a transaction via a platform between a seller and a buyer, wherein the seller and the buyer are far away from each other. The long distance trading system not only protects the seller of the goods by holding the goods at a location until the payment for the goods is settled, but also protects the buyer from paying money in advance before the goods are received so as to minimize the risk of the transaction to both the buyer and seller. In addition, the long distance trading system provides a variety of paying mechanisms.
