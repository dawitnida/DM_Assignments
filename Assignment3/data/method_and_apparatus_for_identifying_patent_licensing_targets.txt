Method and apparatus for identifying patent licensing targets . The present invention facilitates identification of candidate and qualified patent licensing targets through the expedient of assessing technological overlap between patent assets of the licensing entity and third party entities. By using third party patenting activity to drawn inferences about third party business activity, the invention allows a threshold identification of third parties as candidate licensing targets to be made and a further identification of candidate licensing targets as qualified licensing targets to be made without requiring any direct knowledge concerning third party business activity. Moreover, the present invention may be applied in a networked computing environment to allow such identifications to be made with relatively small cost and time commitment.
