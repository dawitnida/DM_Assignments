Global method and system for providing enhanced transactional functionality through a customer terminal . A global customer activated terminal (CAT) that primarily serves traveling customers who require access to their accounts when they are away from their home financial institution and beyond their local regional financial area is provided. The system provides applications that permit users to access their accounts and utilize account profiles and transaction journals within a generic global system approach, and each transaction set provides access to the user's full account profile. The traveling customer is also provided with access to all their accounts linked (as they would locally) to a specific card. The hardware employed in the system supports encryption key downloading, personal identification number (PIN) unscrambling and PIN encryption, so that security is instituted at the hardware level. To provide the maximum flexibility at each regional level for product and services offered, regional front end processors (FEPs) and Hosts (small financial systems) are the arbitrators of each transaction . . . acceptance and fulfillment, rather than the CAT.
