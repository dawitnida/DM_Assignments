METHOD FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTING FOR ASSOCIATIONS USING ACTUARIAL OPEN GROUP SIMULATION . In a method for financial forecasting for an association having current dues paying members and which will have future new dues paying members, a computer and a computer-readable medium are provided having a program operable with the computer. Association variables to be forecast are defined as desired program outputs and including for each of a plurality of periods at least total dues revenue. A total number of the current members, dues paid by each current member, at least one of actual age or estimated age of each current member, and a future dues predictor variable are input to the program. Using at least the actual or estimated age of each current member, it is projected when each of the current members would have a change in dues paying status or would no longer be a member of the association. Using a defined growth rate characteristic for the association, for each of the periods a number of the new dues paying members is projected which will join the association. For each of the projected new members, at least an age for each of the new members and dues for each of the new members based on the future dues predictor variable are projected. It is also projected when each new member would have a change in dues paying status or would no longer be a member of the association. From the inputs the program calculates the desired outputs for each of the periods.
