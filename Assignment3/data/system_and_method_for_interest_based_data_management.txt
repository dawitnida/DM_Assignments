System and method for interest-based data management . The present invention is a computer-implemented tool for strategy planning, risk analysis, and negotiations. It is an interest-based information management system that organizes information about the interests of various stakeholders in a planning session or negotiation on issues relevant to the stakeholders. The tool enables users to evaluate information in complex decisions. The tool is useful to decision-makers in evaluating possible actions that will satisfy or harm their own interests to varying degrees and that will satisfy or harm the interests of other stakeholders to varying degrees. The tool manages a large amount of information and brings rigor, discipline and consistency to the decision analysis process. The system enables decision-makers to develop and evaluate action plans for satisfying their interests through a negotiated agreement and develop and evaluate fighting alternatives for satisfying their interests in the absence of a negotiated agreement.
