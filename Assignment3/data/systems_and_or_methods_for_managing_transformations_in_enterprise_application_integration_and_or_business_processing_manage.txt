Systems and/or methods for managing transformations in enterprise application integration and/or business processing management environments . In certain example embodiments of this invention, systems and/or methods for managing transformations in Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and/or Business Process Management (BPM) Environments are provided. In certain example embodiments of this invention, when a process and/or transform is defined, design-time encoding data is extracted and stored as metadata. When the process or transform is implemented, runtime data is captured and/or managed, and also stored as metadata. When new processes and/or transforms are defined, and/or when an already-defined process and/or a transform is executed, heuristics may be applied so as to suggest one or more already-existing transformation chains for use in accomplishing at least a part of the same and/or a similar process or transform.
