System and method for managing investment accounts for a financial institution which provides investment assistance to individual client investors .

The system is available on a global computer network at an internet site which is accessible to client investors of a financial intermediary through a link from an internet site of the financial institution. A first portion includes a series of questions to develop a risk profile of the client investor. From the risk profile, a suggested investment solution is determined by the system from a plurality of investments, such as various mutual funds, available from the financial service provider. The second portion provides information relating to the suggested investment, including a profile of typical investors and risk/return characteristics. A third portion, with information from the client investor, results in a completed investment application, which, when signed by the investor and forwarded to the financial service provider, opens an investment account which is established and maintained by the financial service provider on behalf of the financial intermediary for its client investors.
