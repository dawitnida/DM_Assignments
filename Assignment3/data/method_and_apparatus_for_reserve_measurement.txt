Method and apparatus for reserve measurement . The present invention describes a method and apparatus for constructing a historically based frequency distribution of unknown ultimate outcomes in a data set, the method comprising the acts of: (A) collecting relevant data about a series of known cohorts, where a new group of the data emerges at regular time intervals, measuring a characteristic of each group of the data at regular time intervals, and entering each said characteristic into a data set having at least two dimensions; (B) determining a number of frequency intervals N to be used to construct said distribution of unknown ultimate outcomes; (C) for each period I, constructing an aggregate distribution by: (a) calculating period-to-period ratios of the data characteristics; (b) identifying a range of ratio outcomes for cohort I; (c) constructing subintervals for cohort I; and (d) calculating all possible ratio outcomes for cohort I; and (D) constructing a convolution distribution of outcomes for all said possible ratio cohorts combined, by: (a) selecting outcomes for any two cohorts A and B; (b) constructing a new range of outcomes for the convolution distribution of cohorts A and B; (c) constructing new subintervals for the convolution distribution of cohorts A and B; (d) calculating the combined outcomes for the two cohorts A and B to provide a resulting convolution distribution; and (e) combining the resulting convolution distribution with the distributions of outcomes for each remaining cohort by repeating each of the preceding acts D.(a) through D.(d) for each pair of cohorts.
