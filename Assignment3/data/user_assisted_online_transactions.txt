USER-ASSISTED ONLINE TRANSACTIONS . "One feature provides an online system that assists users (or sponsors) in selecting and purchasing goods and/or services for themselves and/or others (or recipients). A sponsor may provide the funds for the purchase but delegate the purchase decision to an assistant user or group of assistant users (also referred to as a ""voting group"") within an online network community or social group. The voting group may have the autonomy as to the specific item (good and/or service) to buy and make purchase decisions on behalf of the sponsor. The sponsor may set limits on the amount to spend for any particular gift or a particular period of time within which to purchase any particular gift. This online system removes the specific buying decision (e.g., which particular item to buy, researching particular items, or shopping for an item) from the sponsor, thereby saving the sponsor time."
