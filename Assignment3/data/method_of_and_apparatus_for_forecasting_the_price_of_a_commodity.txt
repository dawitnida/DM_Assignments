Method of and apparatus for forecasting the price of a commodity . A pricing engine that automatically forecasts a price of a tradable commodity so that a quote price can be generated that will remain valid for a pre-defined time window. The pre-defined time window is typically a short time interval which is long enough for the user to evaluate the price and trade on it if required. In one implementation, the pricing engine forecasts what the price is likely to be at the end of the pre-defined time window and that forecasted price is then used as the basis for the quote price.
