This invention is related to a method of diversification which considers the level of potential for conflict of interest (COI) risk as part of a diversification process. The COI has its origin in the interaction among market participants, market structure, business arrangement and practice.

This method provides a direct analysis of the COI risk that associates with entire investment process and the manager, and it is further integrated into the portfolio creation process.
