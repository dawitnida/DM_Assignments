System and method for electronic contracting . A system and method for generating, executing and maintaining electronic contracts in connection with indirect financing transactions involving an acquisition by a customer of an asset offered by a vendor with financing provided by an independent finance source. In one example embodiment, the system includes an e-contracting application that generates an electronic contract based on the one or more contract templates provided by the finance source and information provided by the customer. The e-contracting application provides the generated contract to one or more contracting parties, including the customer, the vendor and the finance source. The application then receives one or more holographic signatures indicating execution of the contract by the contracting parties and generate an e-contract package by digitally signing each one of the electronic contract and the one or more holographic signatures using one or more digital signatures. The application then stores in a database the digitally signed e-contract package and one or more digital certificates associated with one or more digital signatures.
