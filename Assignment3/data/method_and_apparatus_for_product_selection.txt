Method and apparatus for product selection . A method for determining a total benefit derived from a subset of products in a product portfolio includes identifying a set of customer orders having a set of ordered products from the product portfolio and an order benefit and selecting the subset of products from the product portfolio. The method also totals the order benefits from the set of customer orders whose set of ordered products are included within the subset of products from the product portfolio. An apparatus for use in determining a total benefit derived from a subset of products in a product portfolio is also described.
