Secure online transactions using a trusted digital identity . Techniques for conducting secure online transactions are provided. Some techniques utilize a trusted, secure device that is distributed to a human user, and which only the user can access, a device reader, and a one-time secret valid only to authenticate a single transaction to improve on the traditional transaction model by isolating elements of the transaction with the user on the user's trusted, secure device. Isolating elements of the transaction on the trusted, secure device facilitates a secure transaction on an untrusted machine and over an untrusted network.
