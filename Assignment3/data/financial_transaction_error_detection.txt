Financial Transaction Error Detection . A system and method for receiving transaction data and identifying errors within the transaction data is provided. The transaction data may be received at a transaction data processing system and transactions having errors associated with them may be identified. In some arrangements, the identified transactions may be edited or manipulated, for instance, by a user. In some examples, an error type may be associated with the identified transactions. The identified transactions may be transmitted to a transaction error resolution system for resolution of the error and/or adjustment.
