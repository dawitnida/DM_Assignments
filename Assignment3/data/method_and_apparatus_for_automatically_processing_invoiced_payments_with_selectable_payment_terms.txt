Method and apparatus for automatically processing invoiced payments with selectable payment terms . An automated procurement, invoicing and payment processing system includes a payment financing model that particularly accommodates large purchase amounts using a credit account. A seller presents an electronic invoice to a buyer and selects its preferred payment terms. Upon the buyer's acceptance of the invoice, the buyer's credit account is charged for the invoiced amount. The seller is paid by the financial institution maintaining the buyer's credit account, according to the preferred payment terms selected by the seller. The seller is charged a transaction fee and a risk intermediation rate, as well as a reduced financing rate that is dependent upon the selected payment terms. The system further allows a seller to change its preferred payment terms during the period in which the invoiced amount is financed.
