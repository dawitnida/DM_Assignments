LENDING AGAINST THE VALUE OF A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY . Loaning money includes determining a maximum loan amount based on a value of a life insurance policy. The value of the life insurance policy is linked to graduated basic amount-adjusted tables by age and sex predictive of at least one of the expectations of death or survivorship. The method includes providing a loan to the holder of the life insurance policy in an amount not greater than the determined maximum loan amount with the loan being secured by the life insurance policy.
