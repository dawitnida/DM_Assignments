A property leasing system comprises individual modules, including a transaction management application and a property database for storing data supplied by property providers and property users. A real-time interface is provided between the property leasing system database and a property provider's in-house property management system to extract real time, time sensitive, targeted data available from the provider's in-house property management system. The transaction management application is coupled with the interfaces to the in-house property management systems and the property database to utilize and update data stored in the database and the in-house property management system to automate a leasing cycle between a property provider and a property user.
