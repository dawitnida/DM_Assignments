SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GENERATING AND MANAGING A LINKED DEPOSIT-ONLY ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER . Embodiments relate to systems and methods for generating and managing a deposit-only account identifier that can be portably linked to one or more transaction accounts, at the account holder's discretion. A deposit-only account identifier can be a virtual identifier, such as a temporary or permanent account number. The account holder can publish the virtual identifier to desired persons, financial institutions, or other parties to permit those entities to transmit funds to the deposit-only account. The account holder can move received funds to one or more linked transaction accounts, such as bank checking accounts, money market accounts, or others. Details regarding the underlying account(s) such as geographic location, currency, balances or other information can be retained in confidence, visible only to the account holder. Received funds can be distributed to underlying accounts according to criteria such as the currency or amount of the received funds, time of receipt, or other rules.
