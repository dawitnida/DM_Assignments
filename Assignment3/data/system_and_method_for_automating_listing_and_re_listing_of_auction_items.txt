System and Method for Automating Listing and Re-Listing of Auction Items . A computerized method of listing items at an auction site using pre-stored item numbers and item keys. Item numbers and keys are obtained from the auction site by submitting to the site a generic item description and generic auction parameter data. In response to the submission the auction site returns a verification form with the item number and item key, which are extracted and saved for later use. When an actual item is to be listed on the auction site, a stored item number and item key are retrieved and combined with the actual item description data and actual auction parameter data and the combined information is then submitted to the auction site for verification. The auction site responds and a command is then issued to post the item for sale, after which a listing fee is charged to the user's account by the auction site. Items can be listed with original listing numbers or re-listing numbers, the latter saving the listing fee if the item is sold. Re-listing numbers and key are obtained by accessing a listed item that has not sold at the auction site, re-submitting the item for sale, obtaining the verification form, extracting the original item number and key along with the re-listing item number and key and saving them for later use. Actual item descriptions can contain information that permits the locating of other items the seller has for sale without interfering with the search engine at the auction site.
