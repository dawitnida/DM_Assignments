Annuity Having Interest Rate Coupled to a Referenced Interest Rate . An annuity provides a guaranteed rate of return for a guarantee period while at the same time providing upward adjustments to the interest rate if there is a corresponding increase in a specified referenced rate, which may be a United States Treasury rate or an interest rate that is used to settle a contract that is traded on a financial futures exchange. The guaranteed base interest rate is set at the beginning of the guarantee period, and the annuity account is credited with the base interest rate for an initial pre-defined period, which is some portion of the guarantee period. Periodically, as defined by the pre-defined period, the then-current referenced rate is compared to a base referenced rate that was defined at the establishment of the guarantee period. If the referenced rate has increased, the interest rate that will be credited to the annuity account value will increase by an amount that is based on the amount of increase in the referenced rate. If the referenced rate has not changed or has decreased, the interest rate that will be credited to the annuity account value will be the guaranteed base interest rate that was set at the beginning of the guarantee period.
