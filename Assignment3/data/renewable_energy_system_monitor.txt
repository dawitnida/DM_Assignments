Renewable energy system monitor . A business method for financing renewable energy systems includes offering a home loan to a homeowner in which the interest payable by the homeowner are tax deductable. A lease is also offered to the homeowner for the installation and use of a renewable energy system. A deposit of cash proceeds from the home loan is put into a trust held by an escrow agent for the single purpose of paying lease payments for the lease as each payment becomes due. Such that the proceeds from the home loan are effectively used to defease the debt represented by the lease.
