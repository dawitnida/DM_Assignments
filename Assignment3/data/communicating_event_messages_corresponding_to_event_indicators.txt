Communicating event messages corresponding to event indicators . An event message is created that is associated with an event of interest to a user. A transaction entity obtains a token that corresponds to an account of an aggregating entity. Additionally, at least one type of event is identified. Each identified type of event comprises an event type that is of interest to a user and is intended by the user to be reported to the aggregating entity. The transaction entity identifies an occurrence of an event that corresponds to a previously identified type of event and creates an event message that includes the token. The transaction entity then transmits the event message to the aggregating entity. The transmitted event message is adapted to correspond to at least one indicator of the occurrence of the event that is provided by the aggregating entity for review by the user.
