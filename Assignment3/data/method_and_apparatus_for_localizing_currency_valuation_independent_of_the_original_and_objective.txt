METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LOCALIZING CURRENCY VALUATION INDEPENDENT OF THE ORIGINAL AND OBJECTIVE CURRENCIES . The present invention is a currency translation system that provides for the dynamic translation of a first currency value into a target currency value for the purpose of aiding localization and globalization of financial transactions. The system may be used as a standalone translation system or it may be embedded in a larger application such as a financial analysis program, a spreadsheet, a compound or object-loaded document, dynamic Web pages and other dynamically-generated content, databases or stored procedures, or a Web commerce program. The system takes as input the starting currency, a target currency, and transaction rules. The system maintains a database of currency rates, currency histories, conversion rules and currency representation data. Optimization and backtracking techniques are used to deal with partial rate information and in order to find optimal valuations involving a chain of currency translations. The system can produce a single result or a matrix of results from which the user can choose an optimal valuation. The system also provides for the formatting of a numerical currency value into a presentation specific to the locale of the translation request.
