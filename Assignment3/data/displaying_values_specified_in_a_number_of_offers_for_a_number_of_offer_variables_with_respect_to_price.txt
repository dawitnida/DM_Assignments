Displaying values specified in a number of offers for a number of offer variables with respect to price . A method for displaying values specified in a number of offers for a number of offer variables with respect to price includes receiving data for multiple offers that reflects values specified in the offers for multiple offer variables and generating a display of the received data. The display includes multiple offer variable windows that are each associated with an offer variable. Each offer variable window includes an offer price axis representing a range of offer prices and an offer variable axis substantially perpendicular to the offer price axis that represents a range of values for the offer variable associated with the offer variable window. Each offer variable window includes multiple bars. Each bar represents a value specified in one or more offers for the offer variable associated with the offer variable window and is positioned with respect to the offer price axis according to an offer price specified in the one or more offers. A height of the bar with respect to the offer variable axis represents the value specified in the one or more offers for the offer variable associated with the offer variable window. Each bar is associated with a quantity indicator that indicates a quantity of items specified in the one or more offers. In each offer variable window, a marker substantially perpendicular to the offer price axis visually marks a particular offer price that is linked to every other marker within every other offer variable window such that the markers are operable to visually mark substantially equal offer prices within the multiple offer variable windows. The marker is movable by a user to visually mark a particular offer price and, in response to being moved by the user, automatically causes every other marker within every other offer variable window to move to visually mark the particular offer price within the other offer variable windows.
