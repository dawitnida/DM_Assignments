METHOD FOR ENABLING AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBES TO ATTRACT EQUITY CAPITAL INVESTMENT . A business method for deferring federal corporate income tax, whereby a pass-through entity, such as an LLC, is linked to an FT Corporation, which functions as a portable subset of a tribal reservation. Such a structure enables investors to participate as direct equity shareholders in the pass-through entity, thereby ensuring their right to vote as a minor or majority equity interest holders. The structure also enables those investors to participate as virtual equity shareholders in the FT Corporation, so that they can enjoy the tax-exempt status and other financial benefits that have been conferred upon FT Corporations by the Federal Government as a means to help Indian Tribes achieve economic self-determination, without those business entities being disqualified for such special treatment.
