System and method for facilitating electronic transfer of funds . A system for facilitating electronic transfer of funds includes a transfer administrator in communication with a transferor institution, one or more intermediary institution, and a transferee institution, the transferor institution having an account at the one or more intermediary institution. The transfer administrator may be configured to receive an incoming payment request designating said transferor institution, a quantity of funds to be transferred, and the transferee institution. The transfer administrator generates and issues a translated payment order based at least in part on the incoming payment request and configured to accomplish a transfer among the transferor institution, the one or more intermediary institution, and the transferee institution. Finally, the transfer administrator may facilitate processing of a balancing payment among the transferor institution, the one or more intermediary institution, and the transferee institution.
