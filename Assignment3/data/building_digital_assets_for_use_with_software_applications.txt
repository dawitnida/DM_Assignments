Building digital assets for use with software applications . The present invention extends to methods, systems, and computer program products for building digital assets for use with software applications. When a digital asset is received, the digital can be classified based on digital asset type and/or a specified platform type where the digital asset is to be utilized. Digital assets are assigned build rules that can be at least partially inherited based on where the digital asset is stored. Build rules are stored along with corresponding assets in common data structures. When a build command is received, a build rule for a digital asset is accessed from the common data structure. Digital asset builds can be distributed across a plurality of salve modules that perform individual tasks of the build process. Different branches of a software application including different digital assets and/or different versions of digital assets can be maintained in parallel.
