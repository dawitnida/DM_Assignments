Scoreboard for Managing Bank Teller Performance Variability . "Methods and systems for a performance measurement are disclosed to reduce teller performance variation. The process may generate individual and organizational report views of both actual performance and process capability of banking tellers. The performance may be based on one or more actual teller or teller-related performance metrics. The performance may then be compared to, for example, ""Best-in-Class"" performance, ranked amongst others, and/or analyzed for trends and process capability. Finally, underperforming tellers may be coached for improvement in those areas where rankings were low."
