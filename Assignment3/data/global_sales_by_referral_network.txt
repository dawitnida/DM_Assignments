Global sales by referral network . PEER BAZAAR enables, fosters and manages a global peer-to-peer sales process through a global peer-to-peer e-commerce network to distribute consumer products/services through its business model, proprietary software, and web-hosting infrastructure. PEER BAZAAR enters into distribution agreements with publishers and owners of goods/services and digital assets. The data about the goods/services and the digital assets are stored in a central server and downloaded upon completion of a peer-to-peer and/or user transaction. Users purchase products/services by downloading from PEER BAZAAR's website. Users then try out the products/services. If they are satisfied or not, they write reviews and recommend the product/service to others. Such referrals are recorded and tracked, and if anyone downloads the goods/services and/or title responsive to the referral, then the referring individual gets a reviewer credit or the like which may be a percentage from the sale of the goods/services/assets.
