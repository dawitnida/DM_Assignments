SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CASH DISTRIBUTION AND MANAGEMENT . A multi-channel delivery system can be used to provide instant, 24 hour access to financial services. A customer can apply for a financial service through any of a number of channels, such as a Web, call center, or branch channel. After receiving a pre-approval, the customer can travel to a branch channel, where necessary, in order to undergo an identity verification process and receive a decision on the application. If approved, the financial service can be provided within about five minutes of approval, such as by transferring funds to a debit card. For subsequent financial service requests, the customer can access the system through one of the channels at any time of the day to receive an automated decision and, if approved, funding of the request within five minutes of approval.
