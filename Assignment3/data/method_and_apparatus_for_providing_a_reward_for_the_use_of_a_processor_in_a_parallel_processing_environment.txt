METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING A REWARD FOR THE USE OF A PROCESSOR IN A PARALLEL PROCESSING ENVIRONMENT . A parallel data processing system in which a plurality of data processing devices are coupled to a data network. Each of the data processing devices has a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. A reward is provided for use of the processors. A job includes a plurality of tasks. Responsive to a request signal from one of the data processing devices, one of the tasks is sent to the one data processing device over the data network. The one task is stored in the memory of the one data processing device. The processor of the one data processing device retrieves the one task from the memory. The processor of the one data processing device performs the one task to define a result. After defining the result, the reward is provided to a recipient associated with the one data processing device.
