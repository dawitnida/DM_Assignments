System and method for deep interaction modeling for fraud detection . "The use of a variety of plastic cards to carry out monetary transactions is on the increase. It is important to ensure that such transactions are authenticated, authorized, and accounted in a best possible manner to prevent fraudulent transactions. However, as much the transactions are being protected, the fraudsters are becoming that much more cleverer and are being able to break into the system. One of the important requirements is to protect transactions of cash cards as these cards seem to be an easier target for fraudsters. A system for cash card fraud detection involves ensuring that a cash card user's unique ""signature"" is determined and kept track of during the course of the use of the cash card."
