Investment grade managed variable rate demand notes . A financial instrument in accordance with the principles of the present invention permits a dedicated pool of debt capital to be actively deployed without the introduction of a third party source of security or collateral to cover the principal portion of funds being deployed as a predicate to effectuating those investment operations. The dedicated pool of debt-capital can be used for the purposes of permitted asset management without a subsequent deployment of available note proceeds to an underlying commercial project or investment. A financial instrument in accordance with the principles of the present invention standardizes the format, pricing, practice, and methodology of raising debt capital in the capital markets. Thus, a financial instrument in accordance with the principles of the present invention creates an environment that is conducive to the direct and consistent correlation of the institutional short-term investment market to the alternative investment or hedge fund market, thereby potentially fostering the creation of a new debt-based asset class that would produce a means of indexing and regularizing the alternative investment or hedge fund market within the investment marketplace.
