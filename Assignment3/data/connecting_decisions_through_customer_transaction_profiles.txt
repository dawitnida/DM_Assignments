A hierarchy of relationships among the financial services/channels is generated. Transactional behaviors of the customer related to each of the financial services/channels is summarized, using one or more analytical approaches executed on the hierarchy of relationships, to generate a customer level transactional behavior summary. A customer profile associated with the customer is generated which includes the transactional behavior summary and aggregated information on recent financial transactions associated with each of the financial services/channels. A score for a risk decision can be generated for one or more specific services/channels, based on the customer profile.
