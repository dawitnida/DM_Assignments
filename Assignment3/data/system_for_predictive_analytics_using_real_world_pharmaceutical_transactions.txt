SYSTEM FOR PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS USING REAL-WORLD PHARMACEUTICAL TRANSACTIONS . A system for predictive analytics using real-world pharmaceutical transactions includes a computer having a processor and memory, a data collection component configured to aggregate data for a plurality of pharmaceutical transactions, and a data reduction module configured to eliminate non-compliant transactions to generate a reduced transaction data set. An analysis module applies multiple linear regression analysis to a portion of the reduced transaction data set to identify key regression variables that correlate with an excess total return to shareholders. The analysis module also applies logistic regression analysis to a portion of the reduced transaction data set to identify key regression variables that correlate with an increased probability of regulatory agency approval. A report generator provides a graphical output of the identified key regression variables and a probability value corresponding to a likelihood of regulatory agency approval.
