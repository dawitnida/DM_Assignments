Dynamic prioritization of activities . A system comprises a first store of process instance data, a second store of data including predictions and statistics respectively corresponding to the process instance data, and a dynamic prioritization system configured to selectively access data in the first store and the second store and to estimate a cost of a process instance responsive to the accessing, wherein process instance node priorities are adjusted responsive to the estimate. A method comprises providing a first store of process instance data, providing a second store of data including predictions and statistics respectively corresponding to the process instance data, selectively accessing data in the first store and the second store, estimating a cost of a process instance responsive to the accessing and selectively adjusting process instance node priorities using a dynamic prioritization system responsive to the estimating.
