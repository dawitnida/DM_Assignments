System and method for distributing web content on a network . Content on the World Wide Web is made available for downloading by distributing it to cache providers. The content provider is a distinct entity from the cache providers and enters into contractual arrangements in order to benefit from the services provided by the cache providers. The contractual arrangements specify certain rights in cache resources that are bought and sold as commodities, exemplarily through a broker or exchange. An exemplary such right is the right to a stated amount of bandwidth, in a stated time interval, for servicing download requests. Responsive to such contractual arrangements, a redirective element such as a DNS server is programmed to redirect, to one or more cache providers, download requests initially addressed to the content provider.
