Estimating an economic parameter related to a process for controlling emission of a pollutant into the air . An economic parameter estimator is provided for a process that has multiple process parameters (MPPs) and is performed to control emission of a pollutant into the air. The performance of the process is associated with one or more economic factors (EFs). The estimator includes either a neural network process model or a non-neural network process model. In either case, the model represents a relationship between one or more of the MPPs and an economic parameter. Also included is a processor configured with logic, e.g. programmed software, to estimate a monetary value of the economic parameter based on a value of each of the one or more MPPs, a value of each of at least one of the one or more EFs, and the one model.
