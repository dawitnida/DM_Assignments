CAPITAL ALLOCATION SYSTEMS AND METHODS . In an exemplary system, a capital allocation subsystem is selectively and communicatively coupled to a project screening subsystem. The project screening subsystem is configured to aggregate project data corresponding to a plurality of potential projects within an organization and communicate the project data to the capital allocation subsystem. The capital allocation subsystem is configured to facilitate input of one or more constraints on allocation of capital among the potential projects and adjust at least one of the constraints to select a subset of the potential projects for the allocation of the capital such that a return on the capital is optimized.
