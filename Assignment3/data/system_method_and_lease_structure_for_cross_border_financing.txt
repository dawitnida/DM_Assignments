System, method, and lease structure for cross-border financing . System, method, and lease structure for cross-border financing are disclosed. The method uses qualified technological equipment, software, and rights in the software owned by a first party resident in a first jurisdiction, comprising assessing the fair market value of the assets, the first party transferring the rights in the assets to a special purpose entity in a second jurisdiction set up by a second party; and the special purpose entity leasing the assets to the first party under a reverse lease. In a variation, the qualified technological equipment is dealt with in a separate transaction from the software involving a sale or lease of the rights of the first party followed by a reverse lease.
