Method of obtaining an electronically-stored financial document . A method for a bank to obtain an electronically-stored financial document is disclosed. The financial document includes a specific document parameter, such as a record date. The bank maintains the financial document in an off-site storage system when the record date is later than a pre-selected date and in an on-site storage system when the record date is earlier than or equal to the pre-selected date. The off-site storage system is remotely-located from the on-site storage system. The bank receives a request for the financial document from a client and compares the record date to the pre-selected date to determine if the record date is later than, earlier than, or equal to the pre-selected date. In processing the request, the bank utilizes a computer terminal connected to the off-site and on-site storage systems to access one of the storage systems in response to the comparison of the record date to the pre-selected date. After accessing the appropriate storage system, the bank inputs data into the computer terminal to identify the requested financial document and then retrieves the requested financial document. The bank then reproduces the requested financial document and distributes the requested financial document to the requesting client, or some other end user of the bank.
