ITEM RESERVATION . Items can be reserved in advance of a future spot market sale. A reservation price can be determined for the item based on an expected spot market price required to obtain the item in the future sport market sale, a time until the spot market sale, and/or market signals. The reservation price can converge to the expected spot market price as the time of the future spot market approaches.
