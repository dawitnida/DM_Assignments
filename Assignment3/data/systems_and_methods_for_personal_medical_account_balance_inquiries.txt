Systems and Methods For Personal Medical Account Balance Inquiries . The invention is directed to systems and methods for monitoring, retrieving, and/or reporting a personal medical account balance such as an individual flexible spending account (FSA) balance. In an example of an embodiment of the invention the monitoring, retrieval, and/or display of the personal medical account balance may accompany the processing of a claim submitted by a healthcare provider (e.g., hospital, doctor's office, pharmacy, etc.) or vendor (e.g., retail store, drug store, etc.) to an insurance provider. In such embodiments, the monitoring, retrieval, and/or display of personal medical account balance may occur in real-time (or near real-time) with the submission of the claim.
