Systems and methods for real-time, dynamic multi-dimensional constraint analysis of portfolios of financial instruments . An automated method of managing or constructing a portfolio comprising at least one financial instrument defining portfolio attributes, the method using a system comprising a processor, a display and an input device. The method comprises defining at least one objective representing a desired state for the portfolio attributes and defining a set of constraints that are defined in relation to a computable, desired state of portfolio attributes in relation to the at least one objective. A constraints analysis module based upon the set of constraints is generated and provided to the processor. The portfolio is evaluated with the processor using the constraints analysis module and the state of the portfolio attributes based upon the evaluation is displayed. At least one option for altering portfolio attributes in order to more effectively meet the at least one objective is simultaneously displayed. The option is displayed with an interactive user input mechanism that allows for selection of an option and automatic evaluation and display of the state of the portfolio attributes due to selection of the option.
