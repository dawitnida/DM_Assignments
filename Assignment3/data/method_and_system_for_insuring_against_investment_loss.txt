Method and system for insuring against investment loss . Participants purchase into a given system for a given period of time. Those with investment gains, by definition, are without loss and need no compensation from the system. Those with investment losses are reimbursed by the system according to previously agreed upon terms. Total loss of a given system's participants is calculated, with that figure compared to the previously agreed upon amount of funds available for loss compensation (total revenue generated by participant premiums minus previously agreed upon detracted percentage for firm or a sum set forward by the company that is independent of a given system's generated revenue).
