PERSONALIZED INTERNET SERVER . A subscriber at a client station connects to an Personal Internet Service Provider (PISP) station and then chooses a site from which to download data. An Internet Protocol addressing element at the PISP station receives the client station request and retrieves identifying information from a database on a storage device at the PISP station corresponding to the requesting client station. A personal server element at the PISP station uses the client station request to formulate a TCP/IP request to an Internet site corresponding to a URL specified at the client station. The personal server element thus retrieves the requested data and passes it to a caching element at the PISP station. The caching element stores the data temporarily at the PISP station allowing concurrent processes other than the personal server element to control return of the data to client station. The personal server element can also maintain identifying information (e.g. usernames, passwords, etc.) to provide other convenient services to subscribers, including security, automatic data retrieval, and location independent user environment.
