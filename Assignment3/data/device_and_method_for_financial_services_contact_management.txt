Device and method for financial services contact management . The present invention teaches that financial services, in particular mortgage lending/brokerage services may be offered on-line via a consumer contact management system which impels faster responses on the part of mortgage professionals. In particular, when a consumer provides a contact to a financial professional, the information provided is mediated by a central computer system/server/site and divided into specific contact information (such as name, E-mail address, telephone number, etc) and general financial information (such as loan amount, property value, credit history, age, income, etc). The central system then forwards the general financial information to the financial professional but withholds the specific contact information until the professional responds (by way of the same system), at which time specific contact information is provided. Statistics on response effectiveness by any one professional may also be maintained by this device.
