Direct passthrough system for financial contributions . A system for direct donation utilizes an Internet-connected server accessible by potential donors using an Internet browser and a data store accessible to the server and storing information about potential recipients pre-qualified for donations. A software suite executing on the server has at least a first facility enabling a potential donor to view specific information about qualified recipients of donations, and a second facility enabling the same donor to select a recipient and make a direct donation to the selected recipient.
