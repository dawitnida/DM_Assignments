Payment instrument printing and processing method and apparatus . A system used by a transaction processing company/issuer charges a trustee for payment instruments prepared from a sequence of blank payment instruments that the issuer physically delivers to the trustee for use to sell and issue money orders. The system also permits the issuer and trustee to fulfill a money transfer payout transaction, by using the same blank payment instrument stock for printing of a proper payment instrument and providing a controlled and documented shift of responsibility for individual instruments in the sequence of instruments during a mix of money order sales and money transfer payout transactions.
