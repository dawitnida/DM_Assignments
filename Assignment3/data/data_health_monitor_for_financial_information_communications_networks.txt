Each data collection system includes a processor for receiving and formatting financial data received from said data sources, wherein the formatted financial data has a data field including a first data source identifier identifying the data source of said formatted financial data and a first system identifier identifying the data collection system formatting said formatted financial data. The data collection systems also include a status: code generator for generating and transmitting a status code, wherein the status code generator automatically updates the status code when the operating status of a corresponding data source changes; and a heartbeat signal generator for generating and periodically transmitting a heartbeat signal. The client site terminal includes a processor for receiving the formatted financial data, the heartbeat signal and the status codes which it processes to determine whether there is a problem in the receipt of the financial data which prevents the terminal's receipt of the data in real time.
