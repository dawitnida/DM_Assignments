Systems and methods for automatically processing customer discounts and generating marketing data . A store or other entity distributes checks that designate a value for a consumer discount to be received toward the purchase of goods and/or services. The document or instrument within which the discount is indicated is actually a check that may be processed in accordance with the normal processing and routing of any other check that a business may receive in exchange for goods and/or services. Advantageously, separate processing above and beyond that which is normally provided for normal check processing is not required. The check is drawn for a nominal amount and is usually substantially less than the value of the discount that is received by the consumer. Banks will still process the check for the nominal check value notwithstanding the fact that the actual processing fees incurred may be equivalent to the value of the check. The check may be made payable to the business entity and the bank statement may be useful in determining consumer feedback information.
