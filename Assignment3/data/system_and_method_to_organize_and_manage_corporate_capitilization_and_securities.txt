System and method to organize and manage corporate capitilization and securities . The present invention is a system and method for organizing and managing corporate capitalization and securities. A database tracks the complete capitalization, not just the administration of options. For a privately-held company, if the holder of a derivative security, such as a warrant, decides to exercise that derivative security, then the system will issue the holder shares of stock related to that security. The company can access and update the data in the database via a web connection. The data can also be used to perform analyses and determine the effect on the capitalization structure of future actions.
