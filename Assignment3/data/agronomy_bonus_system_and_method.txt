Agronomy bonus system and method . A method and system for encouraging farmers to sell at least portions of their production through an agricultural cooperative entity, wherein a farmer earns price discounts and/or rebates for purchases from the entity of inputs to his or her production upon sale of such production. The farmer contracts to sale such production either at or above a set price on a fixed date by way of selling a Chicago Board of Trade or a Minneapolis Grain Exchange call option or a swap in the Over The Counter Market or, if that price is not achieved, to sale within a year of his or her contract at a price of his or her choosing. The rebate or discount, as a portion of the call option or swap premium received, is then made available to the farmer for purchasing any of selected inputs available through the entity.
