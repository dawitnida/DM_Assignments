Method and system for valuing an equity-related instrument . "Various embodiments of the present invention relate to an Economic Accounting Model which divides any equity-related instrument into a common stock component, a liability component, and an asset component (one or more of which may have a zero value). In one example (which example is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive): (a) the initial common stock component corresponds to the ""equity delta"" of the security, or the ratio of the change in value of the security to the change in price of the underlying stock; (b) the liability component corresponds to the PV of fixed cash outflows multiplied by the probability of these outflows; and (c) the asset component corresponds to the PV of fixed cash inflows multiplied by the probability of these inflows."
