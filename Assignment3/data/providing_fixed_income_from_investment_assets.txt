Providing fixed income from investment assets . A method and device for providing a fixed income from a range of assets is disclosed. In one aspect, the assets are divided into a first group associated with relatively low liquidity risks and a second group associated with liquidity risks higher than that of the first group such that the second group does not need to be liquidated sooner than a predetermined length, such as five years. An asset in the second group is sold only when that asset has gained in value by a predetermined amount, such as 20%, over the principle within a predetermined period of time, such as a year. In another aspect, investments in the second group are made in at least two asset classes that have historically exhibited a strong inverse price correlation with each other. The holdings in the two inversely related asset classes are rebalanced when the performance of one class exceeds the performance of the other class by a predetermined amount, such as 80% of the average of the maxima or minima in historical performance difference.
