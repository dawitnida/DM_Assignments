E-commerce development intranet portal . An intranet providing a multiple-carrel public-access kiosk is disclosed. The intranet provides free access to foreign and domestic informational e-commerce intranet sites as well as e-mail and public service educational and informational materials. The kiosk accepts anonymous pre-paid cards issued by a local franchisee of a network of c-commerce intranets that includes the local intranet. The franchisee owns or leases kiosks and also provides a walk-in e-commerce support center where e-commerce support services and goods, such as pre-paid accounts for access to paid services at a kiosk, can be purchased. The paid services provided by the carrel include video-conference and chat room time, playing and/or copying audio-visual materials such as computer games and music videos, and international e-commerce purchase support services such as customs and currency exchange. The third-party sponsored public service materials include audio-visual instructional materials in local dialects introducing the user to the use of the kiosks services and providing training for using standard business software programs. Sponsors include pop-up market research questions in the sponsored public service information and receive clickstream date correlated with the user's intranet ID and answers to the original demographic questions answered by the user.
