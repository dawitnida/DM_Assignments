SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FACILITATING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OVER A NETWORK . A system for facilitating financial transactions over a network includes a first user device, a second user device and a payment processing device. The first user device is adapted to allow a first user to send an invitation to a second user, via a network, to accept a promise to pay (IOU). The second user device is adapted to allow the second user to generate a response to the invitation via the network. The payment processing device is adapted to receive the invitation and the response and to schedule a payment if the response is an affirmative response.
