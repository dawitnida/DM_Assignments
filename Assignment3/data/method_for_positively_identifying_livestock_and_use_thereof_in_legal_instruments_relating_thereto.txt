Method for Positively Identifying Livestock and Use Thereof In Legal Instruments Relating Thereto . The present invention comprises a method for identifying individual animals, and for using such identification in the creation of a secured interest therein. It relies on a unique and immutable characteristic of each animal, together with a system for representing such characteristic by a symbolic indicator. The symbolic indicator is used in instruments that create or relate to an interest in the animal, to facilitate subsequent identification of the animal, and execution of the secured interest by the secured creditor and search of recorded interests by third parties.
