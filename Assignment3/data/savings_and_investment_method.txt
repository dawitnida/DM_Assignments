Savings and investment method . A savings and investment method where a first party rents at least one wholly-owned investment property to at least one second party; deposits all net income received in an account, charges all living expenses to a credit facility, periodically clears the balance of the credit facility with funds from the account to avoid paying interest on the credit facility; and saving money in the account. The method may also be applied to dividend income from shares/securities.
