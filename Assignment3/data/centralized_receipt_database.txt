CENTRALIZED RECEIPT DATABASE . The present system provides a method to automatically collect and consolidate transaction information into a single database that can be accessed by a user. The system provides a unique identifier or authorization from a user and whenever that user executes a transaction of any type, whether on-line, in person, with a credit or debit card, or via cash, the particulars of the transaction are recorded and provided to a central database associated with the user so that an automatic history of that user's transactions is recorded.
