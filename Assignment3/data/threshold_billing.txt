Threshold billing . The present invention involves a system and method that facilitate a purchasing experience in part by consolidating any number of purchases and their respective charge amounts until the purchases or charge amounts reach a threshold level. The threshold level can be based in part on resources used (consumed or purchased) or on the corresponding monetary value. The threshold level can be determined based at least in part on several factors such as the type of resource being purchased, the volume of resources purchased at a time or over a period of time, customer's payment history, customer's usage history, feedback received from the customer's payment provider, the type of payment vehicle (e.g., credit card, stored value card), time of the purchase, etc. When the threshold is reached, payment is requested asynchronously. The customer's account can be suspended or cancelled if payment cannot be secured within a desired amount of time.
