Capital allocation and risk management . In an approach to financial management, a data representation is formed that defines a number of data elements and relationships between the data elements according to one or more regulatory requirements. Data characterizing availability of particular ones of the data elements for a financial institution are accepted, and actual or potential compliance by the financial institution with at least some of the regulatory requirements is then analyzed. The analysis can include identifying gaps in collection of values associated with the data elements for the regulator requirements, which can relate to calculation requirements and/or to reporting requirements for the regulations. Data representing computations associated with the regulatory requirements can be stored and the computations can then be executed to validate other implementations of the calculation.
