Barter intermediation-prepayment trust . Many typical Vendor/Buyer relationships present long term business situations, either contractual or non-contractual, that offer predictable cash flows over a defined period. Some Vendors, anxious to obtain these supply relationships, may have aggressively expanded their assets, resulting in excessive balance sheet leverage. It is the purpose of the BIP Trust to provide a mechanism whereby the supply relationship cash flows can be approximately matched with undervalued Vendor Capital Obligation maturities to capture Intermediation Profits through the barter of these Obligations in settlement of supply invoices. Capital markets often undervalue long term supply Contracts that the Buyer is in a unique position to confidently assess the value and the performance risks. The Vendor and Buyer, by explicitly linking some or all of these relationship cash flows, which may be significantly under-appreciated by the capital markets, with the Vendor's undervalued Obligations, have the opportunity to capture Intermediation Profits. Contrasted to a contract monetization that takes profit out of a supply relationship, it is the purpose of the BIP Trust to capture value from the capital markets while leaving intact the profit potential of the supply relationship.
