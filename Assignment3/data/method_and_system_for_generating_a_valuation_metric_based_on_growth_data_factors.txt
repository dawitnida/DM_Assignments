Method and system for generating a valuation metric based on growth data factors . The present invention relates to a system, method and apparatus for evaluating a variety of financial information, determining a valuation metric, and distributing the valuation metric to system users. The valuation metric distribution may be configured by an administrator for automatic distribution of the valuation metric to system users. Alternately, a system user may log onto a central server to access the valuation metric, based on administrator defined or user-customized system data. The valuation characteristic provides a system user with a metric that may be used to assist in allocating the user's financial resources. The metric is determined by analyzing three main types of financial indicators, specifically an earnings-yield factor, an interest factor and a growth indicator.
