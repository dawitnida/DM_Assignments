Regulatory data uniform submission component . The invention relates to a system and method for collection, analysis, and submission of data for use in financial regulatory compliance in the insurance industry. In a preferred embodiment, the invention integrates an independently developed, standardized financial statement for collection of data by an insurance company, analyzes the collected data for compliance with specifications of a regulatory authority, and submits the data electronically and by other means to the regulatory authority. The financial statement provides detail on each insurer's business and investment risks, as well as information on insurance claims and reserves. The financial statement is one of several elements used by regulatory agencies and insurance-industry services providers to assess the financial strength of an insurance company. This assessment provides a reliable, objective means of indicating the financial strength and performance of insurance companies.
