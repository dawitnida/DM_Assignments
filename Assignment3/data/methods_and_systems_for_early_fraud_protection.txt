Methods and Systems for Early Fraud Protection . Embodiments of the invention provide for improved early detection of fraud through user-defined monitoring of financial account information and communication of alerts and notifications of user-defined individualized potentially-fraudulent account activity to users. Embodiments of the invention permit an account fraud detection service provider to provide account monitoring services. The user may use the fraud detection service provider to monitor any number and type of financial accounts, and the user may define account notification rules or filters under which the user may choose to be notified of certain potentially-fraudulent account activities. The user may receive alerts and/or notifications of the user-selected account activities using a method selected by the user, and may therefore maintain awareness of account activities and be alerted of any troubling activity in a manner most convenient and effective for the user's needs.
