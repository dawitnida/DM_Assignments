Automatic generation of rib rules in computerized financial management system . Financial management applications may operate according to RIB rules in which expenditure budget limits are increased as an organization or department thereof realizes revenue. When such applications operate in conjunction with complicated data structures for revenues and budget, it can become burdensome to define a plurality of RIB rules individually. A configuration system includes a RIB strategy array containing a relatively small set of meta-rules for identifiers of various portions of a revenue data structure to which they apply. An automated configuration system surveys the revenue data structure, determines which value transforms and destination addresses of a budget database apply and generate a larger set of RIB rules that will govern in the financial management application during normal system operation.
