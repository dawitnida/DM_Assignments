System and method for displaying a combined trading and risk management GUI display . "A graphic user interface is disclosed that combines a traditional trading, bookkeeping system or clearing system window with a detailed margin and/or collateral asset calculation analysis window on a single screen. The disclosed GUI provides the flexibility to analyze any combination of products or instrument classes such as single stock futures, futures (of all types), options (of all types), forward contracts, security options, securities and cash-based assets. Conventional systems merely block entry of orders beyond a predetermined credit limit or display clearing/bookkeeping information on all types of portfolio or accounts. The disclosed GUI, in an automated real-time or manual execution control basis, provide the user useful information (all types of numerical and/or graphical display) concerning which products contribute to and how much each product position contribute to the margin limits on, for example, multiple levels; all types of product level, product period (duration) level, account level and clearing level, etc. In one embodiment, the margin window may include a ""what if"" Scenario Panel and an ""Actuals"" Margin Analysis Panel. This Scenario Panel allows the user to experiment with ""what-if"" scenarios in real time or on an as-needed basis. This allows the user to better assess the changes an ""actual"" position(s) or ""what-if"" position(s) may have on the margin requirements on all account level types. Further, the actual panel displays the account's actual positions and the associated contributions each position has to that account's margin requirements."
