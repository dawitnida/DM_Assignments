POLICY CONTROL AND CHARGING (PCC) RULES BASED ON MOBILITY PROTOCOL . Techniques for supporting policy control and charging (PCC) functions in a wireless communication network are described. In one design, a Policy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) may receive a request from a first network entity (e.g., a home agent) to establish a PCC session for a user equipment (UE) accessing the first network entity using a mobility protocol (e.g., Mobile IP). The PCRF may determine the mobility protocol used by the UE based on an IP-CAN Type parameter included in the request. The PCRF may determine PCC rules for the PCC session based on the mobility protocol and may send the PCC rules to the first network entity. The first network entity may apply the PCC rules on packets for the PCC session and may count each packet for charging. A second network entity may forward the packets but would not count these packets for charging.
