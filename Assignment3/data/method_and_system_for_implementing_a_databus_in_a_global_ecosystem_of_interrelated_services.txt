Method and system for implementing a databus in a global ecosystem of interrelated services . In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a DataBus data management architecture is presented for the NewWave service platform. It presents an architecture for creating a consistent, enterprise-wide data persistence layer which allows clients to access shared enterprise data. The DataBus achieves this enterprise-wide look by decoupling shared enterprise data from specific applications (breaking down the stovepipes) and opening up the data layer to across-the-enterprise access (given proper authorization). The DataBus architecture is designed from the ground up for global scalability and accommodation of evolving business data models in a highly-distributed physical deployment. Scaling is realized predominantly through the partitioning, while individual partitions are mapped to logical data domains that are defined along more relevant dimensions than entity-type dimensions (e.g., geography, line of business, etc.) and cut across traditional entity boundaries. Central to the DataBus data model is the notion that a data layer represents a shared asset of the corporation that is decoupled from the separate production applications requiring access to this data. The DataBus data architecture combines several main features or facets, such as partitioning, multi-hop finder strategies, externalized associations, object layer mediating access to underlying data storage, support for logical domains and transaction management.
