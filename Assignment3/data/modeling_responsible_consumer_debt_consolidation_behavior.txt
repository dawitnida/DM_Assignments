Modeling Responsible Consumer Debt Consolidation Behavior . A request to generate a consolidation risk score that characterizes a likelihood of a change in a level of creditworthiness of an individual following a consolidation of debt of the individual using a secured line of credit is received. Thereafter, future credit balance increases are estimated for the individual using a predictive model trained using historical creditworthiness data of a plurality of consolidators. These estimated future balance increases are then associated with a consolidation risk score so that such score can be provided. Related apparatus, systems, techniques, and articles are also described.
