Method and system for generating a business case for a server infrastructure . A method and system for generating a business case for one or more alternative server infrastructure scenarios relative to a baseline server infrastructure scenario. A capacity planner determines resource requirements and performance metrics for the server infrastructure scenarios. A total cost of ownership estimator determines from the resource requirements the investment cost for the alternative server infrastructure scenarios and the incremental savings in operating costs for the alternative server infrastructure scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. A business value estimator determines from the performance metrics the incremental business value to a supported business operation of the alternative server infrastructure scenarios relative to the baseline server infrastructure scenario. A business case builder determines whether the total benefit represented by the incremental savings in operating costs and the incremental business value justifies the investment cost for the alternative server infrastructure scenarios. The alternative server infrastructure scenarios may typically include a grid scenario.
