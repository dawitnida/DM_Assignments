System and method for assigning credit to process inputs . Various embodiments of the invention are directed to methods and systems for assigning credit to the external and intermediate inputs of an enterprise-level system or other aggregate process with one or more global outputs that is composed of a number of interconnected local processes. Assigning credit is a mechanism for evaluating the impact of a particular variable, e.g., an input to one of the local processes, on the final output of the aggregate process. In certain embodiments of the invention, credit is assigned to the local inputs of each local process in two steps. First, for each local input, a local credit assignment is obtained. For chained outputs, credit assignment data is provided as calculated for the later stage processes to which the outputs are chained. Second, a global credit assignment is derived for the local inputs from the local credit assignment and the credit assignment information from later stage processes.
