Systems and Methods for Generating a Metric of Financial Status Relative to a Financial Goal . The present invention relates to, among other things, systems and methods for generating a metric of an entity's financial status relative to a financial goal. In generating the metric, the value of an entity's total assets is simulated over time based on data comprising historical rates of returns. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a computer system and method for generating a metric of an individual's probable present-day financial status relative to financial independence on a desired future date. In this embodiment, the metric is called a Financial Independence Score. The Financial Independence score is a single number that represents the individual's financial status relative to achieving financial independence by a desired date.
