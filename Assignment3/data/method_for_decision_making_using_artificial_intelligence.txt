METHOD FOR DECISION MAKING USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE . A method of decision making using artificial intelligence that: receives data associated with a user regarding the situation of the user; identifies action options that the user might pursue; computes normalized scores for each of the action options based on the eligibility and likely outcome of the user pursuing the respective action option; compares the scores to a minimum threshold and to each other using quantitative and qualitative metrics; outputs a list of action options to the user as primary and secondary options to pursue based on the comparison; receives a selection from the user based on the list of action options; and transmits a message to a party who provides the action option(s) based on the selection. The method is, for example, applicable to decision making in the context of personal finance and debt assistance.
