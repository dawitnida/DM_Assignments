Intellectual capital risk analysis system . A system, method and computer program product for processing data are described herein. The system has a first database with patent and patent application information as is typically found in patent docketing systems. The system also has a second database for storing information related to risk elements associated with the acquisition of inventions, the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of patents, and the practicing of inventions. The second database may also contain information about patent prosecution transactions for one or more countries. Upon receiving the appropriate command, the system evaluates certain risks associated with a patent application, a group of patent applications, a patent and/or a group of patents to determine the risk level. The elements of risk may be weighted. The system graphically displays the weighted risk information such that the user has a visual indicator of the relative risks associated with a patent asset or a patent prosecution transaction.
