SYSTEM FOR CONTINUOUSLY OFFERED GUARANTEED FUND HAVING DYNAMICALLY ADJUSTED GUARANTEE LEVEL AND FULL AND PERMANENT ALLOCATION TO RISKY MARKET INVESTMENTS . A system has a guarantee valuation engine that configures a processor with code and enables a continuously offered fund to give effect to a guaranteed return while being always fully invested in traditional assets that correlate to a benchmark. In part, the system has a guarantee that is re-priced on a daily basis with that repricing being included in the reported NAV of the fund. The system stores a high-watermark value of a closing price of a share and uses the valuation engine to determine whether the closing price of a share as of a current date is higher than the high-watermark value. In that event, the guaranteed return is reset to a higher guaranteed return and the database is updated to store the closing price as of the current date as the high-watermark value.
