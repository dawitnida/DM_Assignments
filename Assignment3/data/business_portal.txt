BUSINESS PORTAL . A business portal for the exchange of resources is described. A method of transacting resources may include establishing a forum to transfer resources from a resource provider to a resource seeker, implementing a resource provider rule, implementing a resource seeker rule, identifying a user of the online forum as either a resource provider or a resource seeker, and associating the resource provider rule with the user if the user is identified as a resource provider or associate the resource seeker rule if the user is identified as a resource seeker. The transaction of resources may occur either wholly in the portal or a portion of the transaction may occur in the portal and a portion may occur through the use of a software package. The resources may include a service, funding for a business, an investment, information relating to a topic, or the facilitation of the exchange of a resource.
