Modular financial service instrument . A modular financial service instrument is disclosed herein. The modular financial service instrument allows both the customer and the issuing financial institution to modify the set of features associated with the instrument without requiring the issuing of a new instrument. The modular nature of the instrument allows for a rationalised operational structure that eliminates the necessity for storing each combination of features as a separate product. The modular nature of the instrument allows a customer to select features to create a customisable financial service instrument that suites the customer needs.
