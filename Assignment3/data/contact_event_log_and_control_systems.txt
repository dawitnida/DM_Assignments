Contact event log and control systems . A contact management and control system for managing contact events associated with an enterprise detects a contact event and actuates a contact manager to retrieve information pertaining to the contact event from a contact library. If new information is associated with the contact event, the contact library is updated with the new information. Information in the updated library is subsequently disseminated across the enterprise. A contact event has a set of identifying parameters. When a contact event is detected, the event's parameters are compared to a set of predetermined values to detect a match. If a match exists, then, in response to the contact event, a number of commands are executed according to a predetermined set of at least one rule. The contact information is updated in the contact library, and the update disseminated across the enterprise to appropriate client stations and users having privilege over the updated contact information.
