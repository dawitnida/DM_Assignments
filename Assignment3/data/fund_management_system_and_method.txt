Fund management system and method . A dynamic and flexible method, system and apparatus for managing index mutual funds and index exchange traded funds (ETFs) through using and measuring Relative Strengths and Alphas of the underlying index components to periodically reweight the underlying index components. These reweightings are used in the daily rebalancing of the respective index mutual funds/ETFs to decrease market risk and seek to improve returns above those of the statically weighted index. The disclosure demonstrates how various mutual fund/ETF indexes are flexibly weighted according to Relative Strength and Alpha calculations each standing alone or used in combination. The determination of the relative weights of Relative Strength and Alpha can be made periodically by management using a back testing and computer optimization process. After periodic determination of index component weights the mutual fund/ETF index portfolio rebalancing can occur daily, multiple intervals intraday, or any interval which conforms to regulatory requirements. Portfolios suitable for this method and apparatus include equity, bonds, or hybrids (equity and bonds).
