CENTRALIZED LOAN APPLICATION AND PROCESSING . A credit operations center is connected to provide functionality, monitoring and control over one or more locations, such as a store that may sell goods or services. In conjunction with the purchase of these goods or services, it may be necessary to secure credit for their purchase. To assist with the processing of a credit application, each location is provided with one or more mechanisms to facilitate entry of credit application information. For example, these systems can be more traditional in nature and include scanners and fax machines or more sophisticated and entirely electronic and secure such that a user can be prompted for all the necessary information to apply for a loan. This information is capable of being forwarded electronically to a credit operations center for processing.
