METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INTEGRATING HEALTH CARE PAYERS AND PROVIDER SYSTEMS WITH HEALTH CARE TRANSACTION SYSTEMS USING A SINGLE HIPAA EDI RESPONSE GENERATION COMPONENT . A method, system, and computer program product for integrating Health Care Payers and Providers with a health care transaction system. The health care transaction (HCT) utility solves the problem of integration between these two parties by providing the developer with an application that is capable of automatically generating an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) response message to a request. The HCT utility mainly consists of a servlet (associated with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or other data communication protocol) that forwards an EDI request from a sending party to applications that may act as either a payer or provider. These applications may automatically process and respond to request EDI messages sent from other applications using an EDI processor application. The HCT utility provides the advantage of providing an infrastructure for testing healthcare transactions. Furthermore, the infrastructure enables testing of a variety of transactions from multiple sources. Additionally, clearinghouse testing may now be automated.
