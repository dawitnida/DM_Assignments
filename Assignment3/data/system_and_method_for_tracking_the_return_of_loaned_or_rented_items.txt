System and method for tracking the return of loaned or rented items . A system for tracking a number of items borrowed or rented by customers includes a chute reading identification data from each item as the item is returned through the chute by the customer. Data records associated with the returned items are updated to indicate the items are available, even before the items can be restocked. The time at which an item is returned may be compared with a time at which it is due, with an additional fee being added to an account of a customer borrowing or renting an item that is returned late.
