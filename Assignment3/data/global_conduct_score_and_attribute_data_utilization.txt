GLOBAL CONDUCT SCORE AND ATTRIBUTE DATA UTILIZATION . In one embodiment, a system and method is illustrated as including generating a model using at least one of a global conduct score and attribute data. A range of numeric values may be retrieved, based upon which, a better term is granted in a transaction than would otherwise be granted in the transaction. A comparison may be made between the model and the range of numeric values. Further, a better term may be granted in the transaction where the model falls within the range of numeric values. The global conduct score is computed using an approach including at least one of a feed score approach, and a composite score approach. The attribute data includes page view data, click through data, account usage data, and good purchased data. The model includes a global conduct score model, a weighting model, an AI based model, and an associated network based model.
