Method and system for electronic delivery of sensitive information . A method and related system obtains consent from a user for electronic delivery of sensitive information. The user operating a first computer accesses a web page on a server system to input the consent. The web page prompts for the consent from the user. Once the consent is received at the server system, the consent is stored and sensitive information is delivered electronically to an e-mail address specified by the user. Once consent is indicated, it is communicated from the individual's computer to another computer such as a server over, for example, a modem connection. Having secured the individual's consent, the additional sensitive information may be delivered to the individual's computer as, for example, a URL attachment to an email message.
