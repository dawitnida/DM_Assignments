Systems and methods for cross site capital asset sharing . A cross-site capital asset sharing method facilitates the sharing of capital assets between groups in an organization, such as between different sites within a division of a large corporation, thereby reducing capital expenses by forgoing purchases of capital assets that are available for sharing within the organization. Information regarding cost savings due to forgoing the purchase of assets that are shared is collected. Aggregate cost savings is calculated and used by management in rewarding participation in the savings initiative, planning for future capital purchases and in other management actions.
