Method and system for managing communication of information . A method and system of managing communication of information to a destination utilizes computer hardware and software and a client-server architecture. The system receives information in file form, such as ASCII file form, via a file transfer service and/or in message-based form, such as SWIFT and/or ISITC messages, via a message network. The information that is received in message-based form is converted to file form by a message to file converter and translated by a message format library to an intermediary file format, and the information that is received in file form is also translated to the intermediary format by a message format library. The intermediary file format information can be aggregated and sorted, and is then translated to a preferred file format of the destination and sent to the destination.
