Method for encouraging business investment by providing abandonment value . A method for encouraging capital investment that includes a real option structure in which one company invests in another company and receives an exclusive field of use license plus an equity position. The equity position forms the basis of abandonment value if the option is not exercised, which offsets risk and thus encourages investment.
