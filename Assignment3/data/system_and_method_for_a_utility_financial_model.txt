SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A UTILITY FINANCIAL MODEL . A utility financial model involves the setting of a new utility rate after the introduction of a new utility technology that provides immediate capacity relief, reducing the base load capacity and the peak load capacity to electric power providers. The new utility rate is not based solely on performance of the new utility technology but rather based on fixed and variable costs to introduce the new utility technology.
