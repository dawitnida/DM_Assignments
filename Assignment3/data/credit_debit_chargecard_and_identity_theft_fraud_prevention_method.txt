Credit-debit-chargecard and identity theft fraud prevention method . A new method of fraud prevention for lost, stolen, cloned or on-file creditcards, debitcards and chargecards. This same method will prevent fraudulent transfer of funds from on-line or off-line bank accounts and will prevent the establishment of creditlines or loans in the name of an unwitting consumer. Furthermore, this method can prevent unauthorized accessing of secured computer sites. The method comprises a pre-determined dedicated telephone terminal data-base which is interfaced and/or in communication with: normally closed credit-debit-charge card funding approvalsa; normally blocked banking transactions; normally unauthorized creditline or loan approval; normally inaccessable secured computer sites whereby a consumer-cardholder-subscriber can call the said dedicated telephone terminal database and together with a pre-determined authentication means can open, authorize, approve or access the normally closed/denied operations outlined above for a pre-determined number of transactions and/or time limit just before using them. After transaction(s) and/or time limit expires the open-approval condition will default to the closed-denial mode where it will continue until consumer-cardholder-subscriber wants to re-open the above operations temporarily for his/her own use. It should be obvious that fraud perpetrators will never know when these operations will be activated for brief periods of time and therefore will not be able to perpetrate the fraud. The additional authentication required for the consumer-cardholder-subscriber can be a personal identification number (PIN) and/or password and/or telephone number identification means and/or biometric means especially voice recognition identification on the telephone.
