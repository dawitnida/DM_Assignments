Systems and methods for tracking investment metrics . An interactive user interface for displaying information about one or more publicly traded companies at one time. The interface may comprise a two-dimensional chart comprising an x-axis and a y-axis and means for specifying financial metrics for the x- and y-axes. The interface may also include fields where the user can select the companies whose data is to be displayed on the chart. The interface may also include a time range selection field where the user can specify the date range for the date to be displayed on the chart. An identifier or other type of marker is positioned on the chart at the x and y coordinates for each of the publicly traded companies for each time point in the time range. Further, the markers for each company may be connected by a line. The line for each of the companies may be labeled with an identifier for the company (e.g., stock trading symbol) and each marker is labeled with a date indicator. The interface may further comprise a contour selection field for specifying a type of contour lines to be applied to the chart.
