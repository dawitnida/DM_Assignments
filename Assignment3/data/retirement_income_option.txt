RETIREMENT INCOME OPTION . An option is provided to hedge against the risk of a reduction in retirement benefits or a change in the timing of when such benefits are received. The option may also be used to hedge against reductions in returns from Social Security and retirement savings plans. The option is standardized in that it provides protection against an identifiable set of potential modifications to Social Security retirement benefits and the timing of such benefits as well as reductions in returns from retirement savings plans. At the same time, each option is customized for each purchaser based upon the purchaser's age, income level, investment mix, desired return and other factors.
