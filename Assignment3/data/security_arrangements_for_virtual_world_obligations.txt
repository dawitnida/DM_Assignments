Security arrangements for virtual world obligations . A method and system provides transactions and arrangements in virtual world environments. A user can participate in transactions to acquire virtual property and related virtual rights. In some implementations, real-world and virtual parties can be involved in virtual collateral transactions as well as conditional transfers and/or revocations involving various types of virtual objects and virtual rights. A possible relinquishment of designated aspects of the virtual collateral may result from unsatisfactory compliance with an obligation that is secured by the virtual collateral.
