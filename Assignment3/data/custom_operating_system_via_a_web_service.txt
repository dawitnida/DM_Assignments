CUSTOM OPERATING SYSTEM VIA A WEB-SERVICE . "Operating systems can be constructed through working ""in the clouds"" without dependence on a specific piece of hardware. Over the Internet, an operating system is constructed based on received requests. Received requests disclose modules that are to be added to the operating system and these modules are added. A constructed operating system can be tested in context of a web server and then downloaded to an electronic device. The electronic device boots the operating system from virtual hard disk by utilization of bare metal deployment and/or non-metal deployment."
