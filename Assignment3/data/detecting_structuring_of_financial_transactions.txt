Detecting Structuring of Financial Transactions . A method of detecting structuring of financial transactions by instantiating an autonomous, intelligent, mobile agent (for example, an aglet) and attaching it to an onward wire transfer; gathering patterns of transfer activity at a recipient account wherein identities of parties to the transfer remain anonymous to the agent; and detecting aggregation among the patterns of transfer activity. The step of instantiating may be in response to a cash deposit passing a threshold test for suspicion. Detecting aggregation may identify inward transfers of amounts originally deposited as cash deposits less than a reporting requirement amount. Another agent may be interrogated to determine if more patterns of aggregation relate to a single receiving account. Details of the aggregation and an account association may be stored in a secure data container.
