ECONOMIC INTELLIGENCE FORECAST . Aspects of the invention provide for the use of transactional data in the forecasting of an index score, such as a financial index that predicts market conditions. Such forecasting may better prepare individuals and entities for depressed economic conditions. A comparison engine may be configured to compare the financial variable of the transactional data and the transactional data's date against an index score of an index on a date to determine the correlation of at least a portion of transactions represented by the transactional data with the index score. A selection engine may be configured to select a portion of transactions that are more correlated to the index than other transactions. An index score may be forecasted with the selected transactions. Additional transactional data may be extracted from one or more physical documents, such as an invoice, a statement, and/or commercial paper.
