Card Processing . An exemplary system is adapted for designing card processing models, generating code for card processing systems from the models, testing the code, and executing card processing systems. A model content repository stores elements for card processing models. An integrated development environment allows users to access the model content repository and design card processing models. A deployment manager is adapted to compile and test card processing models that have been defined and stored in the model content repository. The compiled code is executed in a platform runtime environment. Information that is collected from an executing card processing system is communicated to the integrated development environment where the information may be presented to a user.
