Electronic Lending System Method and Apparatus for Loan Completion . A method and system for completing on-line electronic installment loan application (101) completion includes requesting verification documentation from a borrower. Specifically, upon receipt of a partially completed on-line loan application, an analyzer (107) checks personal information, financial information, or banking information provided by the prospective borrower. Where anomalies are detected, a request generator (110) generates a prompt for the user to submit various verification documentation. A document generation utility (111) optionally generates a fax cover sheet, which may include an identifying barcode, that the prospective borrower may used to fax back the verification documentation. Such documentation is received by a facsimile transmission receiver (109).
