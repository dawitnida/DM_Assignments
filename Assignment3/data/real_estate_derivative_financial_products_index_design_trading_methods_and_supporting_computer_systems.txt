Real estate derivative financial products, index design, trading methods, and supporting computer systems . In accordance with the principles of the present invention, real estate derivative financial products, index design, trading methods, and supporting computer systems are provided for property owners and investors to temporarily swap their respective economic interests in owning/disowning an underlying property for a certain period of time, directly or through some middlemen. Therefore in addition to the traditional ways of either buying/selling or renting property, the property owner could consider a third new way of dealing with a property. The present invention provides a very straightforward way to enable property owners to protect the gains or prevent further losses in their property equity value. On another hand, the present invention also allows investors to establish an exposure in a potential property equity appreciation or depreciation in a particular neighborhood.
