Methods and systems for facilitating investment in real estate . Methods and systems for real estate investment comparable to investment in a company on the stock market. Assets from a common sector are included in an investment fund. The fund assets constitute a representative sample of assets of the common sector. The financial performance of the fund assets as a whole mirrors that of assets of the common sector. An asset may be added or transferred so the fund assets continue to constitute a representative sample of the common sector of assets, and so the value of a share (or like interest) in the fund is unaffected. A trading platform may be provided for buying/selling fund shares. A continually updated web-based reporting system on fund assets may include information on the sale of fund shares, and information on the representative sample of fund assets as a whole such as historical information, in-place value, and forward-looking value to facilitate trading.
