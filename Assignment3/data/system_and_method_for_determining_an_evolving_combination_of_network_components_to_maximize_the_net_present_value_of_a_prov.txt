System and method for determining an evolving combination of network components to maximize the net present value of a provider's cash flow . A method and computer program product are presented for selecting and arranging an appropriate combination of network components, or elements, in a communications network. The selection of network components is done in a manner that maximizes the net present value of cash flow resulting from the provision of communications services between nodes of the network. The method comprises the steps of receiving information that constrains network design and price establishment, and then using the constraint information to select a combination of network components for each link in the communications network. According to the invention, the selection of network components is performed for each of several successive time periods, effectively planning the evolution of the network. The selections are made so that the network components satisfy demand over time while maximizing the net present value of the cash flow that results from the provision of communications services.
