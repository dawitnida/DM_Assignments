On-Demand and configurable earned value measurements reporting . A method and system for uniformly displaying and reporting uniform project completion information, such as uniform earned value measurements (EV), of a large-scale project having a number of individual subprojects. A set of EV Calculation Rules are defined and used as a guide in creating the uniform EVs. The uniform EVs are calculated, then reported. The EV Calculation Rules used to calculate the uniform EVs include an identification of components of the databases required, the locations of these components and the mathematical formulae used to combine these components. On-demand, scheduled and/or event agents implement the rules to create the EV reports.
