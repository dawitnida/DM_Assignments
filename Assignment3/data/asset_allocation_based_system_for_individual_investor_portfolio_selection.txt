Asset allocation based system for individual investor portfolio selection . A system for allocation asset based portfolio investment and management provides model portfolios which are selected by correlation to investor's responses to a questionnaire concerning time frames and risk tolerance. Recommended model portfolios are presented to investors by asset allocation class percentages only, without identification of any specific securities of fund holdings of the portfolio and without enabling the participating investor to choose or delete specific assets for inclusion in the recommended portfolio. The system enables the investor only to alter the asset allocation. The model portfolios are professionally overseen and managed for compliance with projected returns and conformance to the assigned asset class. The system can be executed on paper or in the form of computer software run locally or on a network.
