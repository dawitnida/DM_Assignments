SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR OPTIMIZING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE GENERATED BY MARKETING INVESTMENTS UNDER BUDGET CONSTRAINTS . Methods, systems, and computer program products are provided for optimizing financial performance. Time series data describing the financial performance generated by corresponding marketing investments is provided to configure an econometric model. Linear coefficients of the econometric model are adjusted in accordance with the qualitative factors received as inputs from experts. The econometric model is transformed into an aggregated non-linear econometric model that includes non-linear factors that cause the financial performance to change at a varying rate as a function of the marketing investments. An allocation of the marketing investments generated by the aggregated non-linear econometric model is adjusted by applying an optimization algorithm to provide an optimized financial performance.
