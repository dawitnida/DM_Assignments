SECURE CARD WITH STORED BIOMETRIC DATA AND METHOD FOR USING THE SECURE CARD . A secure card comprising biometric data of an individual for identifying or confirming authority of the individual is disclosed. Prior to issuing the secure card a cardholder's biometric data is stored in the secure cards memory. When the secure card is used the cardholder inputs biometric data. This input biometric data is then compared to the biometric data stored in the card. If the input biometric data matches the stored biometric data the identity of the cardholder is confirmed. The secure card also comprises a transparent input area to separate the cardholder from an identity verification machine.
