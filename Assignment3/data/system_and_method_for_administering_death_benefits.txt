The external factor may be a death benefit provided by a preexisting contract, a predetermined dollar amount, equity in a home or other asset, the dollar value of a specified asset, number of dependents of the contract holder, or a financial index. The adjusted benefit amount may vary with deposits and withdrawals by the contract holder. Also disclosed is a computer system for administering such a death benefit.
