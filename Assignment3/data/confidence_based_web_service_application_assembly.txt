CONFIDENCE BASED WEB SERVICE APPLICATION ASSEMBLY . A composite application may be assembled from one or more component services, and at least one component service of the composite application is monitored. A determination is made of a probability of breach for each monitored component service of the composite application and an economic metric of the composite application is computed based upon each determined probability of breach. The economic metric may also consider and expected warranty cost provided to a requestor of the composite application. At least one parameter associated with the composite application or monitored services is then adjusted to maximize overall composite application performance based upon the economic metric.
