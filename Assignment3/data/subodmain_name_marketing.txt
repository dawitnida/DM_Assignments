Subodmain name marketing . A method for identifying an item or service for sale or distribution as a subdomain on a primary domain owned by the operator of the invention, assigning the subdomain name as determined by the buyer or lessor of the subdomain. A primary domain name of the operator is used as a classifying base, and adds subdomain names with unique identifiers for the item. Once such subdomains are assigned and in use, they may be accessed by searchers who are prospective browsers and buyers. When the unique identifier, such as the street address of a property, is entered into a search engine, the search engine directs the searcher to the subdomain of the operator. The invention secures a unique domain name and corresponding web site with subdomain web pages for the item. It customizes the web pages for each property with particular information about the item, and includes pre-packaged related information about buying and selling items and advertisements by ancillary vendors. By its use of subdomain names with unique domain names in specific markets, the invention disintermediates commerce by facilitating direct connections between sellers and buyers, and disintermediates online shopping by avoiding the biases of commercial search engines.
