Assigning customers to activities in marketing campaigns . Methods and systems for assigning customers to steps in marketing campaigns. An assignment module assigns and reassigns the customers to the marketing activities. An evaluation module determines a predicted goal value of the marketing campaign for each assignment. The evaluation module may be coupled to a response prediction module for making the determination. The assignment module does not reassign a customer to a marketing activity that the customer has previously been assigned to. If the assignment module identifies an assignment that leads to an optimum goal value, this assignment may be used when executing the campaign. An execution module may execute campaign steps by performing marketing activities, and a response detection module may detect responses from the customers. The responses may be used in determining subsequent steps of the campaign.
