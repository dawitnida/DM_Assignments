USER SELECTABLE FUNCTIONALITY FACILITATOR . Embodiments of the present invention provide a user station or input medium allowing a user to view available functions and to enter selection information for requesting the association of one or more functions with a user operation vehicle. A verifier, responsive to the user station or input medium, can be provided to determine based upon a set of pre-determined rules, whether the user is entitled to the selected functions. A linkage generator can be provided to associate a user operation vehicle with the selected functions after they have been verified by the verifier. A reward function may also be combined with one or more of the functions associated with the user operation vehicle. Interoperability can also be provided between functions on a user operation vehicle based on a pre-determined set of rules. The interoperability between functions may be bidirectional.
