Method and system for evaluating the investment ratings of a securities analyst . "Systems and methods for measuring the performance of calls on securities by a securities analyst during an evaluation period are disclosed. According to various embodiments, the system may include a performance evaluation module. The performance evaluation module is for determining a value (called the ""hit ratio"") indicative of the success of the calls by the analyst for securities within a benchmark group of securities within an industry covered by the analyst relative to a benchmark return for the benchmark group for the corresponding call periods of the calls. The hit ratio may be computed as the ratio of the sum of the actual excess returns to the sum of the total available excess returns for each call by the analyst over the call evaluation period. The contributions to the hit ratio by each call may be equally weighted or weighted according to market capitalization of the rated security."
