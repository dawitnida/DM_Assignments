Method to improve debt collection practices . A method of improving debt collection from a debtor acquires pertinent debtor information in real time or near-real-time. Newly acquired debtor information is used in a debt collection decision procedure which determines the appropriate debt collection strategy to use with a debtor based upon the most recently acquired information. A preliminarily used debt collection procedure can be adapted or modified in real time, or on-the-fly, using the most up-to-date information, which is typically best acquired during a debt collection process.
