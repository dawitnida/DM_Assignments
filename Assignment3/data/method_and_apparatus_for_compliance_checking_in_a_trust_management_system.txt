Method and apparatus for compliance checking in a trust-management system . A method and apparatus are provided for compliance checking in a trust-management system. A request r, a policy assertion (.function..sub.0, POLICY), and n-1 credential assertions (.function..sub.1, s.sub.1) . . . , (.function..sub.n-1, s.sub.n-1) are received, each credential assertion comprising a credential function .function..sub.i and a credential source s.sub.i. Each assertion may be monotonic, authentic, and locally bounded. An acceptance record set S is initialized to {(.LAMBDA., .LAMBDA., R)}, where .LAMBDA. represents a distinguished null string, and R represents the request r. Each assertion (.function..sub.i, s.sub.i), where i represents the integers from n-1 to 0, is run and the result is added to the acceptance record set S. This is repeated mn times, where m represents a number greater than 1, and an acceptance is output if any of the results in the acceptance record set S comprise an acceptance record (0, POLICY, R).
