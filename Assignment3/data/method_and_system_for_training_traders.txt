METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR TRAINING TRADERS . "Systems and methods are provided which enable students to participate in a simulated, electronic trading environment. The concept is one where the eSpeed rules based system and GUI may be used to educate students on the trading of financial products. The system may be ""live"" using real-time information and held either in a private virtual community (i.e. intra-school) or a wider community (i.e. inter-school). Fixed rules may be pre-programmed into the system or modified/customized by the participants. Participants may access the simulation via, for example, the Internet. The products traded in the simulation may include any simulated fixed income financial product. However, the simulation may not involve trading real financial products where there would be real financial risks. Simulated trading may be compared to real-world trading to create new financial products that may be tested and traded in the system."
