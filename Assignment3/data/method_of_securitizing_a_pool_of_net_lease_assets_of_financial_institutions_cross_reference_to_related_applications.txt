Method of securitizing a pool of net lease assets of financial institutions cross reference to related applications . A financial securitization transaction, such as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) transaction, that (i) is at least partially collateralized by a plurality of net lease assets where the tenants to the leases are financial institutions generally with assets of less than $10 billion, and (ii) where such securitization may not be fully collateralized by such net lease assets, in which case the remainder of the collateral for such securitization may consist predominantly of obligations (including trust preferred securities, debt and/or surplus notes) of financial institutions, and/or traunches of CDOs backed predominantly by such obligations. By restricting the assets to net lease assets in which the tenants are financial institutions and restricting the remaining assets to predominately obligations of financial institutions or tranches of CDOs backed by such obligations, more favorable ratings are obtainable from the ratings agencies for the securities backed by the net lease assets. In accordance with an important aspect of the present invention, the ratings of the debt securities of the securitization rely on the aggregate pooled credit quality of the multiple financial institutions backing the various net lease assets and the geographic diversity of such financial institutions, instead of on the explicit investment ratings of any one of the individual obligors in the pool. In accordance with another important aspect of the present invention, as opposed to the typical 5%-10% recovery rate assumed for traditional financial institution collateral used in pooled financial institution obligation CDO transactions, the net lease assets are collateralized by property, which translates into a materially higher assumed recovery rate, for example, in excess of 40%. Through the mechanism of the balloon payment provider (which is also an important aspect of the present invention), the net lease assets do not require residual value insurance and the need for equity capital is significantly reduced or even eliminated.
