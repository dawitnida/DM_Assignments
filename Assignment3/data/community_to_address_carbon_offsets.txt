COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS CARBON OFFSETS . A club or community of mineral producers or other interested parties is put together for the purpose of responsibility account for CO2 and/or other pollutants in produced minerals. The community utilizes a community system to track the amount of CO2 that is associated with produced minerals. The community member sponsoring the mineral contributes to the community fund an amount representative of the value of the estimated CO2 as determined by the community system. The community then utilizes the received funds to invest in carbon offset activities which in turn are returned as benefits to the community members so that either those members can sell carbon offset accounted minerals or the community can do so on the community members' behalf.
