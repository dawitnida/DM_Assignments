Methods and apparatus for managing a plurality of investments . Methods and apparatus to manage a plurality of investments are disclosed. The methods and apparatus enable an individual investor who is part of an investment group to perform individual transactions as well as group transactions. Each investment transaction made through the investment group is tracked at the transaction level for each investor. The system creates a sub-account within a main investment account for each investor. Each sub-account is associated with its own cost basis regardless of the number of members added or removed from the investment group. In this manner, new members are not buying into built-in gains. Because the present system tracks the transactions at the individual investor level, it can assemble the pieces to provide a report at any level.
