Methods and systems for providing interest rate simulation displays . In one aspect, the invention comprises a computer system comprising means for displaying on a computer screen a chart illustrating level and volatility of a projected accounting performance based on a plurality of possible future interest rates, wherein the chart comprises a 50th percentile line, a 95th percentile line, and a 5th percentile line, and wherein the 50th percentile line, 95th percentile line, and 5th percentile line represent probability distribution over time of the projected accounting performance. In various embodiments: (1) for each of the one or more vertical bars, the uppermost dot represents a 95% best case for projected accounting performance and the lowermost dot represents a 95% worst case for projected accounting performance; and (2) the projected accounting performance comprises one or more of: net interest margin, interest expense, interest income, and present value.
