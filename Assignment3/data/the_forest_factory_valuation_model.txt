The Forest Factory Valuation Model . Apparatuses, computer media, and methods for determining a value of a forest factory. A stump land value component and a biomass component of a forest factory are determined. A value of the forest factory is obtained by combining the components. The stump land value component may be normalized by a crop rotation time period. A carbon value component of a forest factory may be determined and the value of the forest factory adjusted. A land parcel may be partitioned into land partitions, in which forest parameters are associated with each land partition. A stump land value component, a biomass fuel value component, and a carbon credit value component may be determined from the land partitions. The carbon credit value component may be determined a percentage of coniferous trees, deciduous trees, and corresponding constant values of oxygen generation.
