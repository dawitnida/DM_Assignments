Electronic financing system . An on-line system for approving credit applications is described. The system includes a qualification module for determining which bank should receive a particular consumer's credit application. If the bank denies the credit application, the system automatically analyzes the reason for the rejection and attempts to find a suitable product substitute for the consumer that will be approved by the original bank, or another lender.
