FUTURE CHECKS INTEGRATION . "Embodiments of the present invention provide apparatuses and methods for a system that captures check data as the check is drafted or thereafter, and before the check is presented to the paying bank. Generally, a customer will use a data capture device to capture future check data from a check as the customer drafts the check. The future check data captured includes information drafted, printed, encoded, etc. on the check. Generally, the data capture device is a device, such as a digital pen, a scanner, a camera device, a device included in a customer's personal display assistant (""PDA""), or other data capture system. After the customer captures the future check data, the data is compared to the customer's account information at a financial institution. Alerts are sent to the customer if the customer is in danger of over drafting the account or if potential fraud is detected."
