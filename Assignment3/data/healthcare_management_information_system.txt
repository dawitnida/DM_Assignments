Based on compliance obligations satisfied by the first input data, a first scalable level of compliance is automatically determined. Within the status area of the first user interface an indication based on the first scalable level of compliance is then automatically displayed. Second input data relating to information and associated with a compliance obligation is received, typically from a health care provider, the second input data provided to the second input area. Based on compliance obligations satisfied by the first and second input data, a second scalable level of compliance is automatically determined. Within the status area of the first user interface an indication based on the second scalable level of compliance is then automatically displayed. Additional embodiments of the invention provide for an integrated healthcare management information system.
