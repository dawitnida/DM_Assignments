RANKING COMMERCIAL OFFERS BASED ON USER FINANCIAL DATA . One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that ranks commercial offers for a user in a set of users. During operation, the system receives financial data for the set of users, wherein the financial data includes spending data for the set of users across a set of categories. Next, for a given user, the system computes an individual-strength vector based on financial data specific to the given user, wherein each entry in the individual-strength vector represents an amount of spending in a respective category for the given user. The system additionally computes a relative-strength vector for the given user based on the financial data for the set of users, wherein the relative-strength vector represents a relative-spending strength across the set of categories for the given user relative to the set of users. The system then ranks the commercial offers for a user based on both the set of individual-strength vectors and the set of relative-strength vectors for the set of users.
