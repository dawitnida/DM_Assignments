Method and system of searching for lost property by using credit card . The invention discloses a method and system of searching for lost property by using credit card used in a credit card service system for searching for a lost suitcase, passport, old person or child with an attached card. The attached card is recorded with at least part of a credit card number. When a lost property is found, an attached card reading device is used to read the partial credit card number, and transmit it and the ID of the reading device to the control center for being stored in the database. Once the user finds his/her property is lost, he/she could transmit a searching message via any credit card reader, thereby the control center compares the searching credit card number and its database so as to find the corresponding contact data matching the searching message, and transmits the contact data to the user for getting his/her lost property back.
