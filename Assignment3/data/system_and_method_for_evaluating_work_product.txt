System and method for evaluating work product . The invention is a system and method for evaluating written work-product which includes several categories in which work-product is rated using a unique set of Levels and categories. An exemplary embodiment of the rating scheme includes a rating scale of integers from 1 to 5, inclusive, in which rating below 3 is considered unacceptable. After a particular piece of work-product is reviewed, another piece of work-product produced by the same person may also be reviewed. Typically, each review is performed by two reviewers. In the event that two reviewers disagree as to the rating of a particular work-product item, a third reviewer, or arbitrator, is used to rate the work-product again to determine a rating for the product. Each creator of work-product may have two or more items of their work-product reviewed to determine the overall quality of the creator's work.
