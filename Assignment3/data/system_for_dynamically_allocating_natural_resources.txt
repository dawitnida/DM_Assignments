SYSTEM FOR DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATING NATURAL RESOURCES . Systems and methods for creating a dynamic resource trust can receive and distribute physical quantities of a resource at a future date. These systems and methods can be implemented in a computer system that dynamically designs and/or values shares of the trust's resources. These systems and methods can permit potential users of resources to tailor the amounts of resources they obtain under different market conditions in the future, with potentially lower costs than costs associated with futures contracts.
