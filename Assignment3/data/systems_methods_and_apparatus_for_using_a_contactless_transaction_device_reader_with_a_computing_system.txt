Systems, Methods, And Apparatus For Using A Contactless Transaction Device Reader With A Computing System . Embodiments of the invention may relate to systems, methods, and apparatus for using a contactless transaction device reader with a computing system. According to one embodiment, a system for conducting a transaction on a personal computing system using a contactless transaction device may include a communications interface operable to connect with a network, a memory, a contactless transaction device reader operable to communicate wirelessly with a contactless transaction device, and a processor in communication with the memory, the communications interface, and the contactless transaction device reader. The processor may be operable to cause the contactless transaction device reader to read information from the contactless transaction device, to verify that the user's authority, to provide transaction information, based at least in part on the information read from the contactless transaction device, when conducting a transaction, and to transmit at least a portion of the transaction information to an entity.
