Transaction processing systems . A banking, retail or other transaction network can comprise a number of terminals, for example an ATM, where each terminal comprises a plurality of peripheral devices such as a user interface, card reader, receipt printer and cash dispenser. The applications software for the peripheral devices can be held in a central server located externally of the terminal and linked to the terminal through a communications link. The link can extend to the individual peripheral devices so that they are direct clients of the server. Additionally the individual peripheral devices can be connected to each other over the link to enable them to communicate directly with each other on a peer-to-peer basis. Each peripheral can have an independent control application. In use, the independent control applications may communicate with each other so that a peripheral operates in response to a signal generated by another peripheral. A peripheral for use in such a terminal, and a network of such terminals are also described. A mainframe or server computer accessing a banking or other information database (e.g., a legacy host) can be connected to the central server through an information signal connection.
