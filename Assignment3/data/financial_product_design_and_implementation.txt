Financial Product Design and Implementation . A front-to-back application suite may integrate new financial products on the fly, without a long development phase. A financial product type, such as a derivative product or structured product, may be created and integrated into a financial management suite for pricing, risk management analysis, deal capture, and trading activities. Information describing a financial product type, including one or more financial instruments and parameters, is received via a user interface and a meta language data script is generated to define the financial product type. A corresponding software object may be generated from the markup language data script and then invoked, for example, by interpreting code of the software object via a virtual machine. The new financial product type may be integrated into the financial management suite, so that specific deals may be created based on the financial product type and then trading activities involving the new deal may be performed within the financial management suite.
