Perpetual funding method for mitigating impacts on public infrastructure projects . The present invention generally provides a method for administering project finding, whereby the project administrator receives an endowment or startup grant from a sponsoring entity, and utilizes said endowment or grant to purchase financial instruments offered by that entity. This creates a zero net loss situation for the sponsoring entity. In return, the project administrator receives the income generated by the financial instruments, and pays the project expenses from such income without invading the endowment or startup grant.
