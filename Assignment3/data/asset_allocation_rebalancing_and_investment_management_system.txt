Asset allocation, rebalancing, and investment management system . A computer implemented or enabled method for providing advisors and/or investment management firms with an asset allocation model manager for advising individual investors. This method enables investment management firms to globally define allocation model sets for use firm-wide by their advisors. It may also provide advisors with a customization process for tailoring these global allocation models to their own client investors. The asset allocation models are tailored to the investment suitability and risk tolerance needs of the investor clients. One object of this invention is to assist advisors and investment management firms in targeting a broad spectrum of investors of virtually all income levels. Transactional fees associated with investing, including transfer agency fees and advisor fees, are greatly minimized as a result of this automated, mass customization tool which groups investors into discrete categories so as to provide them with optimum asset management. As a result of this low cost, less hassle method, advisors and/or investment management firms may advise a broader range of individual investors than otherwise. In one embodiment, the disclosed asset allocation model management system operates as a kernel. However, a plug and play system may be incorporated. In a further embodiments, an ACH system, trading system, record keeping system, and/or communication interface(s) (such as advisor-client investor) may utilized in conjunction with this central kernel. An investor interface is also disclosed. The investor can set up an investment account, monitor investment transactions, self-direct investments or communicate with an advisor to facilitate certain investment transactions.
