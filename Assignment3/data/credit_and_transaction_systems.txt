Credit and transaction systems . An Internet-coupled transaction service has a link to a computer appliance coupled to a merchant site, the computer appliance operated by a person who has selected one or more products or services to purchase at the merchant site, and who has selected, through the merchant site, the transaction service to arrange payment, and software executing from a computer-readable medium accessible to the service. The transaction service, via the software verifies the identity of the person, determines a credit worthiness for the person, and the score being sufficient, arranges payment to be made to the merchant on behalf of the person, and arranges repayment terms with the person for the payment to the merchant.
