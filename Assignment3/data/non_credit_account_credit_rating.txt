NON-CREDIT ACCOUNT CREDIT RATING . A consumer's credit rating is derived from non-credit transactions on an account. Each transaction was a purchase by the consumer from a merchant using a pre-paid card. The derived consumer's credit rating can use a total of all of the transactions, totals for each merchant and/or for categories thereof. Here, the account is issued by an issuer to the consumer. Each merchant submits each non-credit transaction to an acquirer for processing by a transaction handler who requests the issuer to obtain payment for the transaction from the account. The issuer forwards the payment to the transaction handler who forwards the payment to the acquirer to pay the merchant for the purchase of the transaction. The derived credit rating can also consider prior credit ratings based upon prior credit transactions.
