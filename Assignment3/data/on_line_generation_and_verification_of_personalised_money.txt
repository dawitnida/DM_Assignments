On-Line Generation and Verification of Personalised Money . Personalised money may be produced on-line and carry an identifier having at least a first and a second data set. The first data set may represent a unique item identifier and the second data set other item related information. Both data sets are encrypted and printed on the money, for example encoded in a data matrix symbol. The user may present the printed money for redemption at which point the data matrix symbol is scanned to retrieve the encrypted data sets. The data set including the unique identifier may be sent to a remote location for decryption and comparison against a stored identifier. The second data set may be decrypted and compared locally. Different encryption may be used for the two data sets.
