Methods and systems for providing customer relations information . Methods and systems for providing information to a mortgage recipient or other customer of a financial institution. A system identifies potential customer inquiries and provides a list of scripts responsive to the potential customer inquiries. If none of the scripts address the customer's inquiry, the customer specifies the inquiry and an additional list of scripts is generated. The scripts include scripted text, account information, and financial transaction information. In one variation, the customer accesses a website maintained by the financial institution and views a script responsive to the inquiry. In another variation, the customer telephones a customer service agent who selects a script responsive to the inquiry, and reads the script to the customer. In yet another variation, the script is provided to the customer via an Interactive Voice Response system.
