Method and system for objectively optimizing manufacturing sourcing . "A scientific complexity quantification system calculates a specific percent complexity index rating for each manufactured product that can be graphed and compared to other products and that is based on mathematical quantifications of each product's key attributes. The complexity index takes into consideration differences in design and manufacturing complexity, financial considerations, product solution complexity and customer experience. The attribute scoring of individual products are then sorted into potential sourcing categories, such as ""outsource,"" ""in house fulfillment,"" or ""further evaluation needed."""
