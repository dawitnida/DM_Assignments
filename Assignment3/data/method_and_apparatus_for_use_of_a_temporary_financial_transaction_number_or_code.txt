METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR USE OF A TEMPORARY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION NUMBER OR CODE . A temporary financial transaction number is generated for conducting a financial transaction, such as for paying for goods or services. The temporary number has limits on use, such as time, and amount limits and limits on the type of goods or services that may be purchased or on the type of business at which the purchase may be made. The limits may be encoded into the temporary number or otherwise linked to the number. User identification information, or information on other authorized users, may also be encoded into the number or otherwise linked to the number. When presented for a payment, the number is checked for validity as well as whether the purchase is within the limits. An authorized purchase is applied against a user bank account or credit card account without disclosure of the account information. The temporary number is printed or is displayed on a display of a portable electronic device for presentation to the seller, or is transmitted to the seller for on-line purchases.
