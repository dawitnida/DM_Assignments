Interactive system and methods for insurance-related activities . Systems and methods for performing insurance related activities are provided. Software can be implemented to provide a (optionally networked) application that includes an interactive interface for use by insurance professionals in managing clients. Personal data can be received for computing a client's financial condition. Business data of the client can be received for computing a business financial condition of the business at the death of the client. An assumption of the business financial condition, including levels of business owned life insurance can be modified. A selection mechanism can also be provided, which when selected displays a representation of a death benefits to the client and to the business, based on the modified assumption. The personal financial and business financial condition can change in relation to a change in the personal death and business death benefit as the assumptions are interactively modified, thereby showing the benefit of business owned life insurance.
