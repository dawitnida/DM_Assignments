Time-based disablement of equipment . A disabling module in communication with a control module operates to disable or partially disable equipment in response to the failure of a user to complete a specific task, such as make a loan or lease payment. When a user makes a payment on an outstanding loan, usually a loan related to specific equipment, such as a motorized vehicle, a control module is notified of the payment. The control module causes the equipment to be enabled or disabled in accordance with payment receipt.
