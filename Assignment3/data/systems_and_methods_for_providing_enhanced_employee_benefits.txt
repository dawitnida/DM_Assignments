Systems and Methods for Providing Enhanced Employee Benefits . The present inventions provide improved funding and administrative arrangements that allow an employer to provide enhanced benefits to certain employees. In general, the arrangement includes means by which the cost of certain insurance, such as life insurance, is reduced through the use of a trust and financing contract. Proceeds from the financing contract are used to pay premiums on the insurance to reduce the cost of that insurance to the employee. The insurance policy may be used to collateralize the financing contract. When a qualifying event occurs, the employee (or designated beneficiaries) is paid a predefined benefit amount and the financing contract is paid off. One benefit of such an arrangement is that it is portable with the employee, who may continue to retain the benefit of the insurance even though he or she may change jobs, or may be unemployed or retired.
