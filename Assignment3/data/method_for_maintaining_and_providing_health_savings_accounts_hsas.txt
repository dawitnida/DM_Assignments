Method for maintaining and providing health savings accounts (HSAs) . A business method for maintaining a Health Savings Account (HSA) (100) by providing availability and more convenient access to HSA funds where an HSA is funded through either employee (101), employer contributions (103), or through an individual line of credit from a qualified financial institution (105). Funds may later be withdrawn from the HSA using either a unique debit card which can draw upon access to the line of credit at the point-of-sale or a written or electronic request for reimbursement.
