EFFICIENT DEBT-CLEARING SYSTEM AND METHOD . An efficient debt-clearing system and method which is applied to electronic finance is disclosed. Internet technology is utilized to establish a direct-finance fund trading platform, whereby debtors can more efficiently raise funds with a lower cost to clear their debts, particularly the debts of credit cards and fiduciary loans. The efficient debt-clearing system functions as the core in the operation of the entire platform. Firstly, a debtor member submits an application to the platform. The platform analyzes the debt and credit of the debtor member and instructs the debtor to enhance his credit. Next, the platform directs the debtor member to the fund trading module to raise a fund. The fund acquired in fund trading is preferentially used to first clear the existing debt of the debtor member, and the debtor re-pays by installments the fund to the platform.
