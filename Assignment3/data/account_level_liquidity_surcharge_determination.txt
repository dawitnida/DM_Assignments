ACCOUNT LEVEL LIQUIDITY SURCHARGE DETERMINATION . Methods, computer readable media, and apparatuses for measuring, calculating, analyzing, and using account level profitability metrics are presented. Various statistics may be collected and compiled into a table, and profitability of one or more financial accounts may be determined at the account level. A prediction model may be created and used to determine the probability of an early balance payoff. An account-level liquidity surcharge may be imposed in anticipation of or as a result of an early balance payoff. Financial accounts may be classified on a variety of bases, and the results may be presented in a report.
