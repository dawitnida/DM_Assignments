Systems and methods for non-account based liability reporting . The present invention provides systems and methods that provide liability and risk exposure information to a reporting entity, while limiting access to account level usage information. Such methods can include maintaining account information associated with a plurality of accounts. A reporting combination is formed from the plurality of accounts, and at least a portion of the information associated with the individual accounts is abstracted. The abstracted information is provided to a reporting entity such that the reporting entity is prevented from extracting account level information therefrom. Systems can include a computer with a communication device and a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium includes instructions executable by the computer to implement the aforementioned method.
