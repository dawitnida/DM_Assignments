METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CREATING AN AUGMENTED REALITY EXPERIENCE IN CONNECTION WITH A STORED VALUE TOKEN . A method and system for creating an augmented reality experience in connection with a stored value token comprises augmented reality software which can be loaded on a general purpose computer. This augmented reality software can be downloaded from an external source, such as the Internet. The augmented reality software may monitor camera signals in order to detect a marker on a stored value token. The augmented reality software tracks the position of this marker relative to camera. The augmented reality software can produce an object which is projected on the image captured by the camera and adjacent to the image of the marker. The projected object can have three dimensions as it is projected on a two dimensional display. In response to certain conditions, the projected object may later be changed so that it contains a graphical item related to the value associated with the stored value token.
