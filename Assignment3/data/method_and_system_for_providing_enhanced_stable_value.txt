Method and system for providing enhanced stable value . Aspects of a stable value product and a total return swap are combined to provide for coordinated investment. A rate based on LIBOR on the amount of the swap plus a percentage is paid in exchange for the total returns on a specified index and a fee is paid in exchange for the stable value. Balances and amounts due are periodically computed and payments of a net difference are made.
