Method for corroborating a gaming jackpot payment . A method for authorizing a witness-less manual payment of a gaming jackpot includes comparing a jackpot transaction value from a payment user to a maximum witness-less hand-payment jackpot value and to a jackpot value from the gaming machine. Confirmed jackpots of suitable value can be authorized for hand-payment without a corroborating human witness. The maximum value is selectable by the casino.
