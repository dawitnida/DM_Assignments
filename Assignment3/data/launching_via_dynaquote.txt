An aggregated display process includes a display process for displaying, in a multicolumn format, an entry for a specific security that is sought for purchase or offered for sale by a market participant on a securities market. These entries, which can be bid-side entries or ask-side entries, each include a market participant identifier, a lot size, and a bid or ask price. The display process includes a tabular display process for simultaneously displaying multiple entries in a table. An aggregate calculation process generates an aggregate value for a specific entry. This aggregate value is equal to the lot size of the specific entry summed with the lot sizes of all preceding entries included in the table.
