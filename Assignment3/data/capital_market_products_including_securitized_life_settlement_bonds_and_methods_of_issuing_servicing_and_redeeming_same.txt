Capital market products including securitized life settlement bonds and methods of issuing, servicing and redeeming same . Disclosed are novel capital market products, e.g. bonds, equities and like, employing a life settlement policy pool as collateral against repayment of principal. One embodiment is a securitized life settlement bond collateralized by a pool of from 100 to 1,000 senior life settlement policies each bearing death benefits expected to mature within the bond term. The aggregate death benefit value of the life policies can be about 10% greater than the face value of the capital product. The collateral can include an investment portfolio, e.g. of guaranteed investment contracts, to pay the premiums on the life policies thereby ensuring the policies will remain in force and eventually yield death benefits. Another investment portfolio, optionally also of guaranteed investment contracts, can be included in the collateral product to guarantee payment of the bond interest or coupon. Optionally, a bond credit guarantee can be purchased to ensure timely payment of benefits on insureds who outlive their life expectancies. Preferably, the life policies are subject to stringent selection procedure to optimize the probability and timing of the death payments. The death benefits can be used to redeem the bond. The collateral can be structured to be worthy of an investment grade rating or better. By collateralizing both the bond coupon and redemption of principal up front with highly credible products using highly rated instruments, a favorable rating can be obtained for the bond. In some embodiments the bond can be offered at from 100 to 150 points over corresponding Treasury bonds and have an A or even an AA rating or better.
