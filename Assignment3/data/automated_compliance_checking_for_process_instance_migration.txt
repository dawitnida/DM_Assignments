AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE CHECKING FOR PROCESS INSTANCE MIGRATION . A business process workflow editorial data processing system can be provided. The system can include a workflow management system such as a BPEL process editing tool, and a repository of templates each template defining a process. At least two of the templates can include a new template and an existing template for an executing instance of a business process. The system also can include compliance checking logic coupled to the workflow management system. The logic can include program code enabled to derive a log of changes between the new template and the existing template based upon added and removed activities and links between activities in the executing process instance, to group the changes in the log according to common activities, to determine a wavefront for the executing process instance, and to migrate the executing process instance to the new template only if the wavefront does not cross any of the groups of the changes, but otherwise rejecting a migration of the process instance to the new template.
