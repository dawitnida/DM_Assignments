System and method for detecting fraudulent transactions . A system for detecting fraudulent transactions is disclosed. The system breaks the transaction down into its component parameters. A first score is computed depending on the propensity of the transacted commodity to be involved in fraud. A second score is computed as a function of the authentication of the remaining parameters of the transaction. A total fraud score is computed from the first score and the second score and compared against a fraud threshold to determine the likelihood of the transaction being fraudulent.
