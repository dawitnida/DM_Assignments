Aggregating event indicators . An account is associated with a token that is adapted to be distributed to at least one transaction entity. An event message is received from the transaction entity that comprises the token and optional additional information corresponding to an event of interest to a user. The event message is associated with the account based upon the token received with the event message and at least one indicator of the event of interest to the user is aggregated with any other existing indicators in the account. The indicators in the account are made available to the user for inspection.
