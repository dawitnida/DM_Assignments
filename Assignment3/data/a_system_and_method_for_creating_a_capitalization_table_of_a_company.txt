A System and method for creating a capitalization table of a company . The current invention is a securities system which takes the capitalization table of a company and enables shareholders to create corresponding shareholder accounts in the exchange. These accounts are verified as the actual person by checking against a known identity database such as Social Insurance Number, Social Security Number, Drivers License, Passport number, Credit Card number or equivalent. In the second step, they are verified as the Beneficial Rights Holders by a Certification Party (Legal Firm, Accountant or other professional party). Third step--the Certification Party verifies the capitalization table has been entered accurately. The Exchange then constantly reconciles the capitalization table each time a trade is conducted so 100% of the Beneficial Rights Holders are identified and verified.
