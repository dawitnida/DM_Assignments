Electronic Vehicle Repair Management (eVRM) . Automated processing of damage data related to a damaged vehicle is described. Damaged vehicle data including vehicle location data is received at a vehicle repair processor (VRP) from a user mobile device (UMD), either at the time of an accident or when a vehicle is disabled. The vehicle data may be augmented by data directly from the damaged vehicle by telematics processing. A repair decision is generated by the VRP based on the damage data which reflects whether or not to treat the damaged vehicle as likely to be commercially repairable. From the repair decision, a vehicle destination is determined by the VRP for delivery of the damaged vehicle, and the vehicle destination is communicated to the UMD.
