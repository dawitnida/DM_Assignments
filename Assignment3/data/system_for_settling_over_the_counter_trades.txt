SYSTEM FOR SETTLING OVER THE COUNTER TRADES . A system for automatically determining a trade settlement pathway comprising: receiving trade pathway preferences from a first and second party with respect to each other; wherein the trade is settled through clearing if both parties have available accounts with a clearing firm and the trade satisfies each party's clearing account credit limitations; and wherein the trade is settled bilaterally if at least one party does not have an available clearing account or both parties prefer to settle the trade bilaterally, and the trade satisfies each party's bilateral credit limitations.
