ELECTRIC STATEMENT PREVIEWING SYSTEM AND METHOD . A system for preparing and delivering credit card statements to cardholders is operated by a credit card processing entity, and includes a statement processing system and a statement preview system. Statements are previewed by a card issuer after providing statement selection criteria to the preview system. After any requested corrections are made to the previewed statements, the statements have encryption and delivery options applied, and are then electronically transmitted to cardholders.
