Sensitivity based data processing apparatus and method . A data processing technique is provided that may be applied for trading and clearing a futures contract, and more generally, for processing data structures identifying two resources terminating at different times, a time instance earlier than these termination times, and a numeric data value which is time independent. At this time instance, resource values and resource amounts are determined. For determining the resource amounts, a sensitivity of the respective resource to a predefined parameter is determined, and the numeric data value is divided by the respective sensitivity.
