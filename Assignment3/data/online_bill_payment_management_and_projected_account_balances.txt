Online bill payment management and projected account balances . User-entered transactions, not yet recorded or processed by a financial institution, transactions generated by the user in other systems such as biller direct websites or presented bills, and transactions received from the financial institution are combined so as to develop and display projected balances at a banking website. Projected balances take into account manually-entered information combined with information for transactions that have already been processed by the financial institution, so as to provide accurate projected balances.
