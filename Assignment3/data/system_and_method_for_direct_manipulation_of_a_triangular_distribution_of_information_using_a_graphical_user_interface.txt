SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DIRECT MANIPULATION OF A TRIANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION USING A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE . A system and method are provided for direct manipulation of a triangular distribution of information using a graphical user interface. The system includes a graphical user interface for receiving user inputted values. The system further includes a data calculator for generating estimates based on the user inputted values, and for generating curves for display on a grid based on at least one of, the user inputted values and the estimates. The graphical user interface respectively receives the user inputted values based at least on a current position of a pointer on the grid. The graphical user interface is capable of applying a direct manipulation, based at least on the current position of the pointer on the grid, to at least one of the user inputted values and the estimates, such that a result of the direct manipulation is displayed on the grid.
