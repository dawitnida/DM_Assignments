Automated method for loan settlement . This method of loan settlement is accomplished by providing automated document production through the internet for all documents relating to a loan settlement, particularly a par loan trading settlement. Once the information is entered by the client and supplemented by the automated system, the system enables the buyer and the seller, on their business or home computers, to access such documents and information, immediately and in a secure and efficient manner. The system itself is accomplished easily by the use of state-of-the art hardware, software and internet links. The system expedites closing, and is used, as well, for settlement of original loans, and/or loans for distressed entities.
