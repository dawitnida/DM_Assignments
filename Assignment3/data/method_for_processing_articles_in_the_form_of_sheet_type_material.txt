Method for processing articles in the form of sheet-type material . The present invention relates to a method for processing sheet material, in particular papers of value such as bank notes, checks, etc., by which different groups of sheet material are processed one after the other. The inventive method for processing sheet material, in particular papers of value such as bank notes, checks, etc., by which different groups of sheet material are processed one after the other starts out from the consideration of largely doing without inputs by an operator and instead analyzing the progress of processing by monitoring the presence of sheet material in an input, and closing or opening an accounting unit for the particular group of sheet material in accordance therewith.
