Method for increasing liquid assets available to at least partially fund living expenses at an assisted living facility . A method for increasing liquid assets available to an individual to at least partially find living expenses of the individual at an assisted living facility includes consulting with the individual to identify whether the individual owns a life insurance policy and, if he or she does, advising the individual as to the availability of selling the policy to obtain funds for paying the individual's assisted living expenses, thereby temporarily deferring the individual's dependence on governmental assistance for such living expenses. To insure that the sales proceeds are used to pay the assisted living expenses of the individual, the proceeds are preferably paid into a trust for the benefit of the individual. In the event that the individual dies before exhausting the sales proceeds, such proceeds may be used to pay the individual's funeral expenses or may be distributed to one or more heirs of the deceased.
