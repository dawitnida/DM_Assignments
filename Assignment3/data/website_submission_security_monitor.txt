Website submission security monitor . Consumer data that is submitted through a company's website is tagged and then monitored to assure that the consumer data is not used for unauthorized purposes. A filtering program is capable of identifying pre-authorized users and routing the consumer data only to those pre-authorized users. A banner logo or seal is used to identify websites that comply with pre-determined standards for maintaining the security and privacy of website submissions. The banner logo or seal is automatically removed from a company's website for the failure of the company to maintain compliance with security and privacy standards of consumer data.
