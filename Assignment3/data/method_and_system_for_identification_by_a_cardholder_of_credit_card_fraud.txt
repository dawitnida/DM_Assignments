Method and System for Identification By A Cardholder of Credit Card Fraud . "A method for fraud detection leverages an existing financial institution's fraud classification functionality, which produces a first level detection, with a ""user-centric"" classification functionality, which produces a ""second"" or more fine-grained detection regarding a potentially fraudulent transaction. After passing through an existing (""institution-centric"") fraud detection technique, a transaction that has been identified as potentially fraudulent is then subject to further analysis and classification at the ""user"" level, as it is the user is presumed to be the best source of knowledge of the legitimate credit card use. Information about the transaction is shared with the consumer, preferably via one or more near real-time mechanisms, such as SMS, email, or the like. Based on the user's response (or lack thereof, as the case may be), one or more business rules in the institution's fraud detection system can then take an appropriate action (e.g., no action, reverse the transaction if complete, deny the transaction if in-progress, or the like)."
