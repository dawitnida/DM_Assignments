Stockholder bonus and participation system . A system and method for providing a cash income source for stockholders. The invention is adapted for implementation, in part, on a digital computer and the Internet. The invention allows stockholders to earn a cash bonus through participation in qualifying programs. Upon registration of shares, a stockholder is allowed to choose a distinct portion of the corporation's market. The market can be divided in any number of countless schemes such as geographically, demographically, along political boundaries, into zip codes, by area codes, by search queries in the case of a search engine, by flight routes in the case of an airline. The stockholder then receives a cash bonus for activities affecting that market segment. Examples of qualifying activities may include signing up investors for that area, or signing up customers for that area.
