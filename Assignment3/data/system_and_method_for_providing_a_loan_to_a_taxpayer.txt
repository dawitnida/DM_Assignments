SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING A LOAN TO A TAXPAYER . A system and method for providing to a taxpayer a loan in an amount based on the taxpayer's estimated tax refund amount due for a current year, the loan being provided to the taxpayer prior to year end of the current tax year and prior to completion and filing of the taxpayer's current year tax return forms with a taxing authority. The taxpayer's estimated tax refund may be based on historical tax refund data as well as current year income data. A loan granting entity may consider the level of tax refunds that the taxpayer has received in previous years as well as income data for the first three quarters of the year to determine a reasonable estimate of the tax refund amount that the taxpayer will likely receive for the current tax year.
