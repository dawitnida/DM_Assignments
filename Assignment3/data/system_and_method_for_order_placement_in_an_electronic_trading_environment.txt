System and method for order placement in an electronic trading environment . A system and associated methods are provided for intelligent placement and movement of orders in an electronic trading environment. According to one example method, in addition to submitting a leg order at a calculated price level, additional orders, queue holder orders, are submitted for the leg order at prices either below or above the calculated price level. Based on this configuration, if the conditions change such that it is necessary to re-price the leg order, there will be already an order resting in the exchange order book at the re-calculated price that can be used in the strategy. Upon re-pricing the leg order, one or more additional queue holder orders will be placed in the market. Other tools are provided as well.
