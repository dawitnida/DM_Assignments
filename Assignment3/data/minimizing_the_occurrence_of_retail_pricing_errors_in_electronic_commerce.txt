Minimizing the occurrence of retail pricing errors in electronic commerce . In a telephone order shopping system, an on-line shopping system, or a brick and mortar store that uses point of sale terminals, retail prices are compared with price bounds in order to guard against inappropriate retail prices caused by data-entry errors in a retail price database. The price bounds may be read directly from a price bound database or computed from antecedent data such as wholesale prices stored in the price bound database. When a retail price is found to violate an applicable price bound, the retail price is flagged for further evaluation.
