Two-Stage Estimation of Real Estate Price Movements for High Frequency Tradable Indexes in a Scarce Data Environment . Indexes of commercial property prices face much scarcer transactions data than housing indexes, yet the advent of tradable derivatives on commercial property places a premium on both high frequency and accuracy of such indexes. The dilemma is that with scarce data a low-frequency return index (such as annual) is necessary to accumulate enough sales data in each period. This invention presents an approach to address this problem using a two-stage procedure with frequency conversion, by first estimating lower-frequency indexes staggered in time, and then applying a generalized inverse estimator to convert from lower to higher frequency return series. The two-stage procedure can improve the accuracy of high-frequency indexes in scarce data environments, and also can mitigate an errors-in-variables problem that arises at very high frequency even with plentiful data (e.g., monthly indexes). In this paper the method is demonstrated and analyzed via simulation analysis and by application to empirical commercial property repeat-sales data.
