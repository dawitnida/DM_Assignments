SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FINANCIAL ACCOUNT ACCESS FOR A MOBILE DEVICE VIA A GATEWAY . Systems and methods for providing secure access of at least one of multiple financial account processors to a mobile device and/or facilitating secure financial transactions initiated from a mobile device via a gateway. One method can include receiving a mobile personal identification number (M-PIN) number and Customer Unique Identifier (CUID) from a mobile device and processing the received M-PIN and CUID to identify a Mobile Unique Identifier (MUID). The MUID identifies an account of at least one financial account processor accessible via a gateway, and the mobile device is provided access to the account through the gateway. Prior to providing the mobile device with access to the account, a set of inquiries associated with the identified financial account processor(s) may be presented to the mobile device, and response information from the mobile device to answer the set of inquiries may be verified at the gateway. The mobile device is provided access to the financial account processor after the response information is verified.
