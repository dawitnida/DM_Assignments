Method for supporting the communication of information via a communications system . The invention concerns a method for supporting the communication of information via a communications system, as well as a service unit, an electronic agent, software products and servers for supporting the communication of information via a communications system which comprises communications networks of two or more network operators. The service unit passes a request for the communication of information to two or more electronic agents which interact with the service unit within the framework of a virtual electronic marketplace for information communication. The service unit prompts the electronic agents, once or several times, through interaction within the framework of the electronic marketplace for information, to submit offers for the execution of the requested communication of information. An offer submitted by one of the electronic agents in response to such a prompt, through interaction within the framework of the electronic marketplace for information, is confirmed to this electronic agent by the service unit, and the service unit initiates the communication of the information via the communications network of the assigned network operator. The electronic agent communicates to a network management unit of the assigned network operator negotiated conditions for the transmission of the information.
