Method and system for selection . The present invention provides a method of copying, using a substrate, object data to a clipboard of a graphical user interface operating system, the substrate having a graphical representation of the object data disposed therein or thereon, the substrate also having coded data disposed therein or thereon, the coded data identifying a plurality of locations on the substrate, the coded data also identifying a layout of the graphical representation of the object data, the method including the steps of: receiving, from a sensing device and in a computer system, indicating data, the indicating data describing movement of the sensing device relative to the substrate, the indicating data also identifying the layout of the graphical representation of the object data, the sensing device, when moved relative to the substrate, adapted to read at least some of the coded data and generate, from the at least some coded data, the indicating data; retrieving, in the computer system and using the indicating data, the object data; and copying the object data to the clipboard.
