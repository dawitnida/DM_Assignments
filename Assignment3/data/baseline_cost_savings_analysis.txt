Baseline cost savings analysis . In one embodiment of the present invention, a cost savings analysis system includes one or more software components. The software components collectively receive from a user one or more first inputs specifying a cost savings goal and one or more second inputs specifying a technique for generating a baseline price. The software components collectively access historical transaction data within one or more databases needed to generate a baseline price according to the specified technique, generate the baseline price, determine a variation between the generated baseline price and an actual price for each of one or more transactions corresponding to the specified cost savings goal, and compare the determined variations for the one or more transactions with the specified cost savings goal to conduct a baseline cost savings analysis.
