Multi-Computer Data Transfer and Processing to Support Electronic Content Clearance and Licensing . Multi-computer data transfer and processing supports electronic content clearance and licensing. Data is transferred by external communication between separate computers which themselves are distinguishable processing entities, such as a licensor station, a licensee station and a licensing system station accessible by a tiered access web site. Licensors submit content, and demonstrative content samples, searchable by licensees. Licenses, which may be generated and delivered electronically, may be granted or denied according to predetermined parameters or analysis of licensing requests. The system may be fee-based, advertising-based, membership fee-based, or may charge a royalty per transaction, and may collect and distribute licensing fees. License progress may be tracked. Licensed content may be delivered and tracked online, and confirmed by licensees by accountings. The system may track royalties based upon these uses, with payment reminders sent to licensees when payments are due, and default notices in the event of late or missed payments.
