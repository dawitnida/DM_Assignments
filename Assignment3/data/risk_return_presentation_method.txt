Risk return presentation method . A system and computer-implemented method for graphical display of risk and return information of an investment mix or an investment portfolio based upon investment asset classes from which the investor selects a mix and assigns desired weights for each asset class in the mix. The investor's risk tolerance is dynamically assessed by graphically presenting different risk and return scenarios for a plurality of investment mixes calculated from the selected asset classes and assigned weights. Once a user selects an investment mix commensurate with the investor's risk tolerance, the investor may then enter financial data corresponding to actual investments, transactions of which are tracked in the system and performance evaluated based upon the investor's targeted risk and return values and benchmark funds consistent with the investors investment mix.
