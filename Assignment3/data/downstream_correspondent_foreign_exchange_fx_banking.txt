DOWNSTREAM CORRESPONDENT FOREIGN EXCHANGE (FX) BANKING . Systems and methods that enable real-time (or almost real-time) foreign exchange (FX) pricing via retail branch networks, wire room operations and cash management platforms are provided. Essentially, the systems and methods decouple the FX-infrastructure and enable downstream banks to effectively and efficiently access FX transaction services and infrastructure without the need to locally manage such an FX platform. In doing so, an FX generation component is employed in connection with standard downstream mechanisms to provide necessary information to a partner FX processing component. The partner FX processing component conveys information to the downstream environment while shielding the downstream entity from risks and costs involved in FX operations.
