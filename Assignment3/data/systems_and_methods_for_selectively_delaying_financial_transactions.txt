SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SELECTIVELY DELAYING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS . A risk system that performs a risk assessment of a financial transaction to obtain an initial risk score. Based on the initial risk score, the risk system performs at least one post-score assessment by selectively utilizing various scoring engines and databases. The at least one post-score risk assessment may include delaying the shipment of merchandise in financial transactions that are of marginal risk to thereby provide a check acceptance service with more time to further evaluate the financial transaction risks. Thus, marginally risky financial transactions that are likely to benefit the check acceptance service and a merchant that subscribes to the check acceptance service are authorized for increased profitability and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the post-score risk assessment may approve or authorize financial transactions that generally fail standard risk assessments that use a cut-off risk score to divide the financial transactions into either approved or declined groups. As a result, the post-score assessment process efficiently re-evaluates some of the borderline exception cases for the purpose of securing beneficial financial transactions.
