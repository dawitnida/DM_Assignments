Business performance index processing system . A computer is used to perform the calculations of obtaining: a required capital composition (an optimum debt/equity ratio) of an invested capital with a corresponding default probability based on a probability distribution of a return on investment; a weighted average cost of capital based on the capital composition, a borrowing cost, and an equity cost; a market efficiency value added from the weighted average cost of capital based on a net operating profit after tax; a socio-environmental value added that represents, in value terms, a social contribution of an enterprise not directly listed in financial statements; and a future inspiration value by adding the socio-environmental value added to the market efficiency value added. This allows business performance to be evaluated appropriately and adequately.
