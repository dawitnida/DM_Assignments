Residential mortgage exchange and borrower trading platform . R-M-X is an online platform design and utility to allow borrowers to search for and execute mortgage loan alternatives across a pool of lenders. R-M-X will allow borrowers and lenders to enter into standardized loans through R-M-X rather than directly as bilateral agreements. Each mortgage will be bifurcated into a credit and funding component. Borrowers and lenders can each separately manage the credit and funding components of the loan. Also, R-M-X will act as a primary and secondary trading exchange and clearing entity for collateral and funding lenders providing trading, clearing and standardization for retail liabilities including residential mortgages.
