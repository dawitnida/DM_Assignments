AUTHORIZATION REFRESH SYSTEM AND METHOD . Limited use account identifiers or secondary account identifiers are enabled with refresh capability. The refreshable account identifiers are used in financial transactions and, specifically, in transaction situations where multiple and/or duplicate authorization requests occur for the same or related transactions. The limited use account identifiers may be used by intermediaries that coordinate the purchase of an item for a buyer. The intermediary also coordinates with the merchant to verify availability of the item, provides the merchant with the refreshable limited use account identifier and provides the purchaser with a confirmation number.
