Selecting Variables For A Treatment Optimization Model . A system and method for selecting variables for a treatment optimization model, to determine an optimal treatment from a number of treatments for a financial account, is presented. A number of variables are stored in a storage bin defined in a database, such that each variable has at least N samples. A measure of informativity (inf) is selected for each one of the number of variables. A measure of usefulness (Mu) is selected for each one of the number of variables. An equation (mInf=inf+Mu*coeff) is calculated for each variable in each bin, where the coeff defines a relative general importance of each one of the number of variables, to determine a set of best variables from the storage bins. The optimal treatment is selected based on the set of best variables.
