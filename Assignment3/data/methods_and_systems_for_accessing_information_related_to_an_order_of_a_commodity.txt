Methods and systems for accessing information related to an order of a commodity . Methods of allowing a customer to access information related to an order of a commodity include gathering inspection information from a commodity lot, collecting grower, field, and packing information associated with the commodity lot, recording purchase orders associated with the commodity lot, assigning a trace code to each of the purchase orders, entering the inspection information; the grower, field, and packing information; the purchase orders; and the trace codes into a central database. Once entered into the central database, the content of a web-based application may be updated with the inspection information, the grower, field, and packing information, the purchase orders, and the trace codes within the central database, thereby allowing the customer to access the inspection information, and the grower, field, and packing information, by entering one of the trace codes into the web-based application. According to one exemplary embodiment, each of the purchase orders associated with the commodity lot is linked within the web-based application.
