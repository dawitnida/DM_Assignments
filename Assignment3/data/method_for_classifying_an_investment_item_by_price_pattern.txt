Method for classifying an investment item by price pattern . The present invention is a novel analysis method whereby investment item from any market or index can be grouped into novel price pattern groups depending upon the investment item's price history over the course of a user-selected period of time. The unique manner in which these groups are formulated offers the user, or investment trader, a much fuller view of the performance of the investment item than the typical raw historical information regarding price for an investment item. Furthermore, since it is possible to apply this technique to many investment items, it allows the investment trader to view pricing trends outside of the traditional boundaries of markets, i.e., NYSE, NASDAQ, etc., or indexes, i.e., DOW JONES, S&P 500, etc. Rather, this technique allows the investment trader to view price trending patterns for any collection of investment items across any market, including global or foreign markets, for any desired period of time.
