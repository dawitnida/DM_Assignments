Method, system, and service for quantifying network risk to price insurance premiums and bonds . The invention broadly comprises a method for determining financial loss related to performance of an internetwork. The method correlates input information regarding performance of an internetwork to operations of a financial entity underwriting insurance premiums and bonds and translates the correlated input information into at least one operational risk for the entity. In some aspects, the internetwork is the Internet. The method gathers secondary external information other than directly from the internetwork, correlates the input and secondary external information, and translates the correlated input and secondary external information into at least one operational risk for the entity. For at least one subset and one peril, the method determines a spread in time and space of effects of the at least one anomaly and peril on the internetwork and on the at least one subset.
