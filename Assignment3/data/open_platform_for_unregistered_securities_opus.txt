OPEN PLATFORM FOR UNREGISTERED SECURITIES (OPUS) . A computer-implemented, web-interfaced method of trading and settlement of unregistered securities issued under an exception outlined in Rule 144A includes providing access to a website in communication with a network. A data structure is established and stored in a memory and includes information relating to one or more unregistered securities and entities involved with the trade. A trade request is received via the network from an interested investor, and a QIB eligibility status is determined for each of the interested investors. Eligible QIBs are allocated an investment slot if a number of allocated investment slots is less than a regulated value. Otherwise, an investment slot is denied to any remaining QIBs. A related system and computer-readable medium are also disclosed.
