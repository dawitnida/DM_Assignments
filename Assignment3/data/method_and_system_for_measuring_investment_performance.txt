METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MEASURING INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE . The present invention relates to a method and system for measuring investment performance (e.g., total portfolio performance of individuals). In one example (which example is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive), the method and system may be used for measuring investment performance of personal pension portfolios. In another example (which example is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive), the method and system may provide for measuring performance of an investment portfolio held by an investor, comprising: providing first information indicating how the investment portfolio has performed over one or more predetermined periods of time; and providing second information indicating how investment portfolios of the investor's peer group have performed (e.g., on average) over the predetermined period(s) of time. In other examples (which examples are intended to be illustrative and not restrictive), the present invention may be used to pool data across employers in relation to pension funds and/or to pool data across wealth management firms or trust companies in relation to underlying client accounts. In another example (which example is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive), simplified portfolio level reporting and comparison of asset allocation strategies may be implemented by the present invention via the categorization of essentially all available financial products into a relatively small number of asset classes (e.g., between about 15 and 20 asset classes).
