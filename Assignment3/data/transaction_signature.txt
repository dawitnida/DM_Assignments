Transaction signature . The present invention provides systems and methods for protecting transaction information stored in a database of a gaming network. To accomplish this, a transaction signature is generated each time the user completes a transaction on a gaming machine. The transaction signature is generated using transaction information from a particular transaction. The transaction signature and transaction information are stored together in a network database. Upon subsequent access to the transaction information in the database, the transaction signature for the transaction information is recalculated based on the transaction information at that time. The new transaction signature is then compared to the transaction signature previously stored. Any differences between the two transaction signatures may be used to signal unauthorized alteration in the database transaction information.
