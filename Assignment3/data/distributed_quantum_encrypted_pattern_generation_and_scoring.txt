Distributed Quantum Encrypted Pattern Generation And Scoring . Transaction scoring is performed in a distributed manner across a client-server computing system. A computing system for processing a transaction includes a server system and a client system. The server system is arranged to process information associated with the transaction, while the client system communicates with the server system and includes a key engine which is arranged to generate keys. The client system and the server system are arranged to cooperate to make probabilistic determinations associated with the transaction. The client is arranged to send the keys generated by the key engine as a transaction to the server system.
