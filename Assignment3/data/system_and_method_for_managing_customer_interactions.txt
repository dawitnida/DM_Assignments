System and Method for Managing Customer Interactions . Systems and methods for managing customer interactions allow an organization or individual to identify, prioritize, and manage customer interactions efficiently prior to a customer reaching a specialized customer service agent or station. A terminal may be used in a lobby of an office or business (e.g., by a lobby leader) to identify, queue, and process customers. For example, in a banking environment, a customer's needs and identification information may be collected and/or identified prior to the customer reaching a bank teller or other transaction station by a lobby leader. In one or more instances, a terminal used by a lobby leader may be configured to process one or more transactions so that the customer does not need to wait in a queue. A lobby leader terminal may also include a variety of other functions to facilitate customer management.
