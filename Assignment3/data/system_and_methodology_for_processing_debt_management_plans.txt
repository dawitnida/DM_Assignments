System and methodology for processing debt management plans . A system and method for creating and managing debt management plans on an automated basis. The system is provided with various personal and financial information from a debtor and/or a credit counselor and then automatically generates a debt management plan for the debtor subject to creditor approval. In one embodiment, each of the creditors is provided with the specifics of the proposed debt management plan and may approve it, reject it or approve it conditionally. Once finally accepted, the system can implement the debt management plan on behalf of the debtor, creditor and credit counseling agency. In one embodiment, a DMP score may also be associated with each debt management plan indicative of the attractiveness of the plan to the creditors. It is also possible for each individual creditor to influence the calculation of the DMP scoring by adjusting weightings of multiple factors associated with the DMP.
