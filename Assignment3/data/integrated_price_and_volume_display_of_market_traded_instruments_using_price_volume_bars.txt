Integrated price and volume display of market traded instruments using price-volume bars . A method and system for providing trading volume information of selected market traded instruments compiling aggregated volume of transactions executed within each pre-selected price bracket for each pre-selected discrete time interval. The data is displayed using price-volume bars incorporated into a price-volume chart. In this manner traders can compare the relative volume of transactions occurred at substantially narrow price brackets for each discrete time interval.
