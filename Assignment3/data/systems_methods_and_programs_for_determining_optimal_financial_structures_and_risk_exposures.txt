Systems, methods and programs for determining optimal financial structures and risk exposures . A model for analyzing a cashflow sensitive instrument is described that uses an optimization model of a data set associated with a cashflow sensitive instrument, which optimization model is based at least in part on an interest rate model and a cash-flow model. The interest rate model is at least partially based on at least one random variable used to simulate an underlying distribution on at least one interest rate. A model output is then generated based on the optimization model. The model outputs all optimal cashflow solution for the cashflow sensitive instrument(s) that at least partially optimizes factors of risk and/or cost. Related methods, programs and systems are also provided.
