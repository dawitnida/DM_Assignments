Joint sponsor-manager handling of custodian transactions . Techniques for approval of reconciliation of an investment account transaction are provided. A first record of a transaction associated with the investment account is stored in an investment account data repository accessible by a first entity and a second entity. A second record associated with the transaction is received from a third entity and is reconciled with the stored first record. Based upon the reconciliation, the repository is altered and an indication of an approval of the alteration, by at least one of the first entity and the second entity, is stored in the data repository.
