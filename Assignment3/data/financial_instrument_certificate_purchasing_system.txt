Financial instrument certificate purchasing system . A system for issuing, transferring and redeeming financial certificates which are representative of underlying publicly-traded property consists of means for carrying out a series of steps which permit an individual to gift a third party with a certificate which represents a company's security or other financial instrument, while not itself consisting of the financial instrument. The system consists of a means for establishing a communication link between a customer and a supplier of the certificates, providing a menu to the customer to permit the customer to select one or more corporate securities or other financial instruments, establishing a communication link between a supplier and a provider of price information relating to the securities, and permitting the customer to select the desired securities for gifting to a third party. The system also includes means for receiving personal information from the customer such as payment information, as well as the personal information of the certificate recipient. Finally, means are included for printing or otherwise creating the certificate, and conveying the certificate to the ultimate recipient. The holder of the certificate may then redeem the certificate at his option, the redemption price being set by the current market price for the underlying security.
