IMS gateway systems and methods that provide session status checking . IMS gateway systems and methods are disclosed for providing mid-session status checking in an IMS network. An IMS gateway system described herein includes a budget control system and a status checking system. When a session has been established in the IMS network, the budget control system performs budget control for the session. Concurrently, the status checking system periodically checks the status of the session. Responsive to the status checking system determining that the session is active, the budget control system continues to perform the budget control for the session. Responsive to the status checking system determining that the session has terminated, the budget control system terminates the budget control for the session. By periodically checking the status of the session, the IMS gateway system advantageously avoids a runaway changing scenario in the IMS network.
