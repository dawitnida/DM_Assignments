System and method for facilitating open item clearance . Systems and methods are disclosed for assisting a user in clearing payments against vouchers in a financial system. A payment requiring user attention may be displayed to the user in an interface of the financial system. The financial system may automatically suggest at least one voucher to balance the payment. The user may also select at least one voucher to balance the payment from a plurality of available vouchers. If the difference between the payment and the combined total of the selected vouchers equals zero, the financial system may allow the user to clear the payment against the selected vouchers. If the system-suggested vouchers are not the ones the user would choose for clearing the payment, the financial system may allow the user to select vouchers to clear the payment.
