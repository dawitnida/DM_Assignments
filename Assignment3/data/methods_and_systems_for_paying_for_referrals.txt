Methods and systems for paying for referrals . "Here we disclose a method for enabling a seller to pay micro-commissions to one or more individuals who deliver a sales message to a prospect. For example, a toy manufacturer might offer to pay people who ask a retailer to stock a particular toy. If the retailer buys the toy then a commission is owed to this group of ""grassroots"" referrers. Each referrer's share of the commission may be very small, a micro-commission. The method comprises a set of steps executed by a computer database system interacting with users. In simplified form the steps are: (1) a seller enters a referral offer into the system, (2) referrers then enter referral claims that identify a prospect and that represent claims on a potential commission, (3) the expected value (EV) payment process of U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,521 is used to ""probabilistically amplify"" the commission owed through a fair bet, (4) if a claim ""wins"" the EV payment bet process, the amplified commission is calculated and an inspector verifies the winning claim, (5) then, if the claim is found valid, the referrer who submitted the claim is paid his share of the amplified commission. In addition, the method can be modified to enable a buyer to submit a claim that a referral has been made by an individual leading to a sale. In addition, the method can be modified enable a buyer to submit a claim that a referral has been made via a medium leading to a sale to the buyer. The method is further modified to enable the medium's owners to be paid, and to enable an individual making a referral in a medium to be paid for that referral."
