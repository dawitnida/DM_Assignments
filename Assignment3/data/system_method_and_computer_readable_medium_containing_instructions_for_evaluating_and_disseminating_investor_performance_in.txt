System, method and computer readable medium containing instructions for evaluating and disseminating investor performance information . An investor's performance is evaluated by utilizing information pertaining to at least one transaction made by the investor, such as an individual or entity, involving at least one investment. This evaluation includes determining a performance score indicative of the investor's performance relative to other investors. The performance score is determined at least in part by considering an average historical performance of the investment, following the transaction. In addition, the performance score is also determined by a historical consistency of the investor's performances with respect to transactions involving the investment, and the number of transactions made by the investor. Then, the performance score of the investor may be compared against the performance scores of other investors. Advantageously, this performance score may be used to produce a ranked list of investors in a particular industry, as well as with investors in different industries.
