INTERCHANGE FEE NOTIFICATION . The embodiments described provide for systems and methods that alert a merchant of increased interchange fees. An increased interchange fee occurs when an electronic transaction, such as a credit card transaction, deviates from a standard set of criteria. For example, the sales person enters the credit card number rather than swipe the magnetic stripe of the credit card. In one embodiment, transaction information is provided to a merchant. The merchant sends the transaction information to an application. If the transaction is non-standard, the application can produce a notification that is sent to the merchant. The merchant may then address the causes of the increased interchange fee.
