Computer-Implemented Method for Evaluating an Investment . A computer-implemented method and tool for evaluating an investment includes functionality that generates and stores data representing values/dates of a plurality of inflows and outflows over the investment period. Such data is used to derive first values that represent expected benefits over corresponding intervals of the investment period. A first net present value result is generated by discounting some or all of the first values, and then stored for output as part of the investment evaluation. The first values account for at least one of: i) interest payments and credits on calculated daily bank account balances (CDBAs) derived from the data; ii) tax payments due on CDBAs derived from the data; iii) VAT payments derived from portions of the data corresponding to forecasted sales of the investment, iv) income tax payments derived from said data, and v) allocation of forecasted net income into a plurality of predetermined categories.
