Anonymous recommendation technique . An entity engaging in one or more activities within an electronic commerce system supplies data such as an entity identification to an anonymity service. In turn, the anonymity service splits the entity identification into a plurality of secret shares that are thereafter provided to a corresponding plurality of shareholders. Information regarding the specific activity(ies) is associated with each secret share of the plurality of secret shares used to memorialize the entity's identity. Over time and multiple activities conducted by multiple entities, each secret share has associated therewith a set of activities corresponding to a plurality of entities. To generate recommendations for a given entity, an intersection of the sets of activities associated with that entity's secret shares is provided as an estimated activities list. The recommendations are thereafter derived based on the estimated activities list.
