Method and system for asset management . Assets are selected as fixed members of a portfolio and the proportion of value of each asset in the portfolio is determined. After some time period, the proportion of the value of each asset has changed because the price of some asset is not constant. Then, new amount of each asset is calculated so that the current proportion of the value of each asset comes close to the prefixed proportion of the value of each asset. The amount of each asset is adjusted accordingly. It is preferable to make the current proportion of the value of each asset becomes substantially equal to the prefixed proportion of the value of each asset.
