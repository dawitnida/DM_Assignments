Method and system for collecting monetary donations . The present invention provides a method and system that electronically collects monies from donor individuals and organizations and distributes these collected monies to designated charitable and other non-profit organizations such as churches. The donor will supply information related to the identity of the designated recipient organization, the amount or percentage of the donation and the frequency of the donations. At designated donation intervals, the specified or calculated monetary amount is transferred from the donor account to the collecting agency. The funds are then transferred to the recipient organization account by the collecting agency. At the completion of this transfer, both the donor and the recipient organization can receive verification of the amount of the transfer. During the time interval between transfers from the donor account, the donor can modify the information that controls the amount of a monetary transfer and the frequency of the transfers from the donor account.
