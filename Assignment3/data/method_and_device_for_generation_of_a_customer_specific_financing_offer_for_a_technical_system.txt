Method and device for generation of a customer-specific financing offer for a technical system . For a simple generation of a customer-specific data set, particularly for generation of a financing offer for the leasing of medical apparatuses, basic data are stored in a central database and centrally updated. The current basic data are transferred to a portable and decentralized computer dependent on need, and for this, the decentralized computer is temporarily connected with the central database. A selection menu is provided at the decentralized computer, via which selection menu the customer-specific data are recorded. In connection with the basic data, a corresponding financing offer is generated with the aid of a calculation program located on the decentralized computer. This enables a sales agent on site to directly and quickly submit a financing proposal to a customer.
