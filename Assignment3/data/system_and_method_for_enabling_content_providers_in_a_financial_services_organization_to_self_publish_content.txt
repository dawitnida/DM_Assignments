System and method for enabling content providers in a financial services organization to self-publish content . Content providers, such as research departments in a financial services organization that prepare research reports, can use a Content Management Application (CMA) to self-publish content to a network. Users, such as internal users, e.g., financial advisors, and external users, such as the organization's clients, can access the content via the network. An administrator uses the CMA to define a hierarchy of nodes, and to entitle specific content providers to upload content to specified nodes. The content providers may entitle their content to certain platforms and user groups. The content providers can directly publish content to make it readily available, and thereby feature the latest research or other information. The content providers can update links on the display to link to new or updated content. A Content Display Application (CDA) is used to display the appropriate content to the entitled users.
