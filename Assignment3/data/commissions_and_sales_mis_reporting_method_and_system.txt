Commissions and sales/MIS reporting method and system . In one example, a method of generating commissions documents comprises calculating commissions earned by a party based, at least in part, on stored data related to the party, generating at least one file comprising at least one of the calculated commissions and the stored data, and converting the at least one file into at least one read-only file. The read only file may be a PDF file or a read-only HTML file, for example. Access may be selectively provided to the file via a network, based on login information. The file may be generated based on a position of the user in a hierarchy table defining relationships between users, such as sales representatives and supervisors. Selection links to information may also be displayed to a user based, at least in part, on the login information, to the user. The file may be e-mailed to users. Systems are also disclosed.
