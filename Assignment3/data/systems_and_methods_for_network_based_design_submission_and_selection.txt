Systems and methods for network-based design submission and selection . In a computer network, a client accesses a management services network and submits a request for a design project. Through the management services network, the client views portfolios showing various work products created by designers associated with the management services network. The client then selects designers, based on the design products shown in the designer portfolios, to be members of a design team for the client. After the members of the design team create initial concepts for review by the client, the client selects one designer to create a design product. The selected designer creates the product and receives payment for services rendered.
