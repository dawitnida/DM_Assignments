VALIDATION METHOD AND SYSTEM . A validation method and system. The method includes receiving, by a computing system, accounting data and an associated purchasing document. The computing system receives a request for validating the accounting data. The computing system determines a purchasing scenario associated with the purchasing document. The computing system receives a configuration table and validation algorithms. The configuration table comprises accounting elements each comprising parameters. The computing system selects relevant accounting elements from the configuration table. The computing system selects relevant algorithms of the validation algorithms. The computing system executes each relevant algorithm of the validation algorithms on an associated set of parameters of the parameters. The computing system generates validation statuses for the relevant accounting elements. The computing system transmits validation statuses to a calling system.
