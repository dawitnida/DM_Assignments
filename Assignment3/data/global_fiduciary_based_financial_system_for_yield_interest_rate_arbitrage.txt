GLOBAL FIDUCIARY-BASED FINANCIAL SYSTEM FOR YIELD & INTEREST RATE ARBITRAGE . A supply-and-demand-driven, bankless, interest-rate and yield-setting mechanism for a fiduciary-based financial system that includes parties who want to trade cash and assets as a way of originating arbitrage transactions for the purpose of making money, includes an interest-rate and yield-setting mechanism constructed to provide the parties with the rates and yields necessary to cooperatively mine arbitrage opportunities and, in turn, make money. The mechanism is constructed to operate according to a market-driven, rate-setting process that establishes interest rates without the participation of banks, and may be constructed for a global fiduciary-based financial system to operate in parallel with the global banking system. Many system and method embodiments are proposed, including an automated arbitrage trading-platform system, and a method of providing an alternative international fiduciary financial system that manages investments and risks associated with the transfer of funds between different parties, while enabling non-banking entities to provide traditional banking services without violating national and international banking laws.
