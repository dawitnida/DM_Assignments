SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A SEPARATE ACCOUNT MORTGAGE . Aspects of the present invention are directed at integrating a home mortgage with a vehicle for long-term savings and investment. In this regard, a method is provided that increases the capital available to a borrower when compared to traditional mortgages, such as a 30-year fixed mortgage. The method includes establishing an integrated account of a mortgage and an investment vehicle that receives periodic payments from the borrower. Payments received from the borrower are bifurcated so that a portion of the payment is directed to the mortgage and the remaining portion is directed to the investment vehicle. In this regard, the method provides means for growing capital directed to the investment vehicle at a rate that is greater than the cost of the interest on the mortgage.
