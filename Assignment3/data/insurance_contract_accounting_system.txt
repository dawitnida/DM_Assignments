Insurance contract accounting system . The present invention aims at providing an insurance contract accounting system capable of reducing waste of document papers for insurance application and eliminating labors of drawing up the necessary documents in the insurance agencies and companies (including their sales branches) while taking advantage of the conventional face-to-face sales of insurance. An insurance contract management device 2 of the insurance company is connected to a terminal unit 3 of an insurance agent through a network 4, so that upon reception of agent authentication information from the terminal unit 3, the management device forwards to the terminal unit 3 an insurance application form for letting the agent enter insurance-related information data thereinto and receives confirming information from the terminal unit 3 upon filling in the application form, thereby to account for conclusion of the insurance contract.
