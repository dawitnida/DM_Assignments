System and methods for creating and evaluating content and predicting responses to content . A method of creating new content based on previously experienced content and content ratings, in which content attributes are obtained and analyzed against set-top box events collected as the content is experienced. Analysis includes determining effects of various content attributes on content ratings, content attribute order on content ratings, and determining a preferred content attribute set and content attribute presentation order. Also taught is a system and method of predicting future events given a proposed dataset, in which past events are monitored and correlated with a proposed dataset sharing at least one attribute with, and having a substantially similar structure to, the past events, and the results of the correlation are reported as a prediction of future events. The invention further includes a method of predicting behaviors of non-sampled demographic specifications based on sampled demographic specifications of a given level, in which past behavior is monitored and correlated with demographic characteristics.
