Fund management system and method for maintaining a private web site in auto-pilot mode indefinitely . A system and method for a family fund management based on an internet family web site is described in which family funds dedicated to some of the relatives dispense monetary rewards to pre-verified beneficiaries. The financial details on the family funds in terms of the principal amount, income from the principal, dispensable amount, past transactions, are readily available for display on the web site in a self-explanatory fashion. The clarity of the financial transactions and the transparency of the financial details allow the family web site being steered largely in an auto-pilot mode, thus contribute to preserving the family web site over many generations at a reasonable financial management cost and to reducing the possibility of financial fraud substantially. It could be preferable to dispense the dedicated family funds only during one short period during the year, such as a few days around Christmas or New Year day.
