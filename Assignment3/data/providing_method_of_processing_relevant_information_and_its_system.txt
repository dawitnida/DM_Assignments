Providing method of processing relevant information and its system . A host device evaluates the writing quality of an ID for management based on digital information showing the writing quality of the ID for management received from an information terminal through a communication network. The host device also executes a correction of information relative to various conditions for marking the ID for management to a semiconductor wafer in accordance with results of the evaluation. Information relative to the evaluation results is transmitted to a terminal for accounting/money collection through the communication network. The terminal for accounting/money collection receives information of the number of writing times transmitted from the terminal, and the information relative to the evaluation results and transmitted from the host device, and then calculates an effective writing time number of the ID for management.
