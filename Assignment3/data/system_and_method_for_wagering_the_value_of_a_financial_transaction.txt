System and method for wagering the value of a financial transaction . A system for establishing a wager comprises a memory and a processor. The memory stores a value of a prize for a wager, and a risk value for the wager. The processor is coupled to the memory and determines odds for the wager, wherein the odds are based at least in part upon the value of the prize and the risk value. The processor further determines whether the wager is won as a function of the determined odds.
