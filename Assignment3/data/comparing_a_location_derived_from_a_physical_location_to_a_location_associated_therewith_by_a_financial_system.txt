COMPARING A LOCATION DERIVED FROM A PHYSICAL LOCATION TO A LOCATION ASSOCIATED THEREWITH BY A FINANCIAL SYSTEM . Data that describes asset attributes is stored in an asset information repository. One of the attributes corresponds to assets' financial application defined location. A network device is detected that links the assets to a network. Device identifiers, through which the assets link with the network, are identified. The device identifiers are mapped to a physical location associated with the network device. The physical location is used to derive a financial location, which is compared to the financial location defined for the asset by a financial system. Mismatches may be identified and reconciled.
