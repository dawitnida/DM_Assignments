A method and means of registering for a debit card includes a card having an account number that is the same as an account number encoded on a magnetic strip of the card. Removably attached to the card is a first and a second label. The first label has the account number printed thereon and a designated area where customer information is filled in. The second label has an authorization code such as a PIN number printed thereon. Both the account number and PIN number are stored in a database maintained by a service provider. To register, the first label is removed from the card and attached to a customer's check and the second label is removed and retained by the customer. The check is scanned and transmitted to the service provider.
