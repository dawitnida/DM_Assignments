APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FRAUD PREVENTION . The disclosed method and apparatus combine interactions and transactions in order to detect fraud acts or fraud attempts. In one embodiment, one or more interactions is correlated with one or more transactions, the interactions is and transactions features are combined, and features are extracted from the combined structure. The features are compared against one or more profiles, and a combined risk score is determined for the interactions or transactions. If the risk score exceeds a predetermined threshold, a preventive/corrective action can be taken. In another embodiment, behavioral characteristics extracted from one or more interactions associated with a transaction, with a risk score obtained by analyzing the transaction. The behavioral characteristic are used to enhance suspicion level related to a transaction being fraudulent, and to enable the taking of measures related to the transaction or to the person handling the transaction. The combination thus enables better assessment whether a particular interaction or transaction is fraudulent, and therefore provides for better detection or prevention of such activities. In addition, making the fraud assessment more reliable enables more efficient resource allocation of personnel for monitoring the transactions and interactions, better usage of communication time by avoiding lengthy identification where not required, and generally higher efficiency.
