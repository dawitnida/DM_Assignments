INTERACTING WITH USER AT ATM BASED ON USER PREFERENCES . Embodiments of the present invention provide apparatuses, methods, and computer program products that allow for interaction with a user at an automated teller machine (ATM) based on pre-established user preferences. For example, an ATM is provided having: (1) a user interface configured to receive user identifying information from a user; and (2) a processing device operatively coupled to the user interface and configured to use the user identifying information to determine a pre-established user preference, wherein the processing device is further configured to use the user interface to interact with the user based at least partially on the pre-established user preference.
