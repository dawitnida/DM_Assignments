SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SMOOTHING FINANCIAL DATA . Systems and methods for aggregating groups of input financial data such that the aggregated data reflects trends more smoothly than the input financial data are provided. More specifically, various methods and systems of the present invention provide for aggregating one or more selected data points from a set of input data points into an aggregated data point, wherein each data point includes at least a high value and a low value. The aggregated data may be presented in various ways to visually depict trends in the data. For example, in the case of a price bar chart, one or more input price bars can be aggregated into a single price bar, with the effect that jumpiness or noise that might exist in the input price bar(s) is removed by the presentation of the single aggregated price bar.
