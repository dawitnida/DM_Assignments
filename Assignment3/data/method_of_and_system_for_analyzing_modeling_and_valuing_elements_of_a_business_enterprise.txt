Method of and system for analyzing, modeling and valuing elements of a business enterprise . An automated system (100) and method for analyzing, modeling and valuing elements of a business enterprise on a specified valuation date. The performance of the elements are analyzed using search algorithms and induction algorithms to determine the value drivers associated with each element. The induction algorithms are also used to create composite variables that relate element performance to enterprise revenue, expenses and changes in capital. Predictive models are then used to determine the correlation between the value drivers and the enterprise revenue, expenses and changes in capital. The correlation percentages for each value driver are then multiplied by capitalized value of future revenue, expenses and changes in capital, the resulting numbers for each value driver associated with each element are then added together to calculate a value for each element.
