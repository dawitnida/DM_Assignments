HOME WARRANTY METHOD AND SYSTEM . A method of selling a home includes entering into a contract with a buyer to sell a newly constructed home to the buyer, and entering into a warranty agreement with the buyer. The warranty agreement warrants a majority of the components of the newly constructed home for a time period from the date of the contract, requires the buyer to comply with a maintenance schedule to be verified by periodic inspection, and conditions at least a portion of the warranty on the buyer's compliance with the maintenance schedule. The method may include collecting a transaction cost from the buyer, where the transaction cost includes a cost for the home and a cost for the warranty.
