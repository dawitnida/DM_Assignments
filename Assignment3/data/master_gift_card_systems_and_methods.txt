In an aspect, a stored value instrument is associated with a subaccount that has access to a portion of an amount stored value in a master account. There may be many such subaccounts associated with a master account, and each subaccount may have its own associated stored value instrument. Beneficially, this arrangement can allow a master account holder to assign a specific portion of the stored value in the master account for the use of each of the stored value instruments, while still maintaining the ability to administer the master account.
