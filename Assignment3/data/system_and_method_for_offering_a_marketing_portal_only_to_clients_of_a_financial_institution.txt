System and method for offering a marketing portal only to clients of a financial institution . A marketing portal server comprises a marketing portal website; a client identification engine for confirming that a user is a client of a financial institution; a posting engine for enabling a client to post a directory listing on the marketing portal website; and a directory engine for enabling a client to view at least some of the directory listings on the marketing portal website. The client identification engine may identify a client by client name and ATM pin number. A client enrollment engine may determine subscription information based on client status, and the directory engine may manage directory listings based on the subscription information. An exchange engine may manage an electronic commerce site for clients. A payment engine may perform debits and credits for transactions occurring on the website. A client rating engine may rate clients. Geographic limitations may be imposed on a client or on a directory listing.
