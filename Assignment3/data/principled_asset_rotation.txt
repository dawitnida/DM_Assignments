Principled asset rotation . A method of investment for positive returns in both bull and bear markets that involves rotation of investments between at least two types of assets (Class A and Class B) based on the relative performance of two related indexes. If Class A outperforms Class B in the previous time period, the portfolio is invested in Class A assets for the next period of time. If Class B outperforms Class A in the previous time period, the portfolio is invested in Class B assets for the next period of time. The indexes are evaluated after each time period to determine what class the assets are invested in for the next period of time.
