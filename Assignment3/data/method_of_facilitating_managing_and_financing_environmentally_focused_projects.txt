Method of facilitating, managing and financing environmentally focused projects . A method of funding environmentally-driven public or private works projects (e.g., stormwater management and diesel fuel usage and emissions reduction projects, and generally any environmentally-driven project) that creates legacy utility or user fee-based programs so as to address urgent or mandated, environmental-related public concerns. The fund is employed to allow for projects to pass from concept to feasibility to operations stages without the need for interruption due to financial resources. Projects include any local government, State or County-influenced government, or private industry-focused initiative that triggers negative public attention and/or any potential federal sanction, penalty, or specific public notice or cost due to inaction, lack of study, or lack of seed funding mechanism. Examples include stormwater management, NPDES, floodplain management, water supply development, coastal shore protection development, wetlands banking, natural resources protection area, parks protection, water/wastewater systems, industrial air pollution abatement, diesel fuel use and emissions reductions, or other environmental development concerns.
