Method and system for lease . A lease payment plan for leasing property such as a motor vehicle for a specified lease period is determined, by setting a shorter period shorter than the lease period, from a partial cost to be recouped within the shorter period and an entire cost to be recouped over the entire lease period. The partial cost is calculated in accordance with an initial value of the property and a first residual value at the end of the shorter period. The entire cost is calculated in accordance with the initial value of the property and a second residual value at the expiration of the lease period.
