Method and system for valuing intellectual property . An automated system and method for determining the value of an intangible asset or intellectual property and developing a fair remuneration structure for licensing or purchasing the intangible asset or intellectual property by comparison to a dissected database of prior licensing and sale transactions. Valuation determinants and remuneration structures from prior transactions are extracted, analyzed and weighted and loaded into a knowledge base. Remuneration structures are normalized and used to train predictive algorithms based on a market analysis of previous transactions. The algorithms are able both to learn from previous transactions and to assess the importance of particular valuation determinants in determining the value under particular circumstances. An equitable rate for a new transaction is determined by examining the knowledge base and varying the valuation determinants. An optional expert system and dynamic modeling environment are provided.
