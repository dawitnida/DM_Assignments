System and method for managing foreign payments using separate messaging and settlement mechanisms . Managing foreign payments using separate conduits for messaging and payments. An originating depository financial institution can create an F3X message designating a fixed amount of foreign currency to be credited to, or debited from, a receiving depository financial institution. The originating depository financial institution transmits the F3X message to a domestic gateway operator via an ACH network. The domestic gateway operator then forwards the F3X message to a foreign gateway operator. Separately, the originating depository financial institution transmits a payment to the foreign gateway operator either directly or via a correspondent financial institution. The foreign gateway operator matches the payment to the F3X message and transmits the payment to the receiving depository financial institution.
