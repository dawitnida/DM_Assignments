SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING VALUE-ADDED CONTENT IN AN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT . In various exemplary embodiments, a system architecture and associated method to provide value-added content in an electronic communications environment occurring over a communications link between a first electronic system provider and a third-party cloud provider is disclosed. The system architecture comprises an electronic communications interface to allow translation between the first electronic system provider, additional electronic system providers, and an end-user to the third-party cloud provider. The electronic communications interface further provides the first electronic system provider with at least a portion of the content within communications streams from the additional electronic system providers and the end-user via the communications link. A visual generator provides display regions to the end-user with the value-added content from the first electronic system provider that is related to the at least a portion of the content of at least one of the communications streams.
