Apparatus and methods for processing items . Apparatus and methods for processing assets in a lockable container are disclosed. A decoupler receives information from the container or the asset in the container. The container may be associated with a security status, and the item may be associated with a processing status. The decoupler may move the container along a processing path in a sequence based on the security status of the container and/or the processing status of the asset. The decoupler may also lock or unlock the container while moving the container along the processing path. At least a portion of the processing path may be exposed to a magnetic field, which may lock or unlock the container and/o activate or deactivate a security tag associated with the container or the item. The decoupler may also write or read information to or from an RFID tag associated with the container and/or the asset. This information may be used in conjunction with benefit denial, audit, loss prevention, transaction management, and other similar systems.
