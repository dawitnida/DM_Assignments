Method and apparatus for arranging and displaying healthcare plans in an electronic chart format . A server maintained by or for a healthcare plan provider arranges and displays healthcare plans in an electronic chart format to a member of an organization preferably on a screen of the member's computer (e.g., via a website hosted on the server and accessed by the member). An application running on the server receives a geographic identifier from the member and determines an availability score for each of the healthcare plans based on the identifier. The application then selects a set of the healthcare plans based on the availability scores and determines a savings score for each of the plans in the set. Each savings score relates to the costs of providing a predetermined group of medical (e.g., dental) procedures. The application then organizes or orders the set of healthcare plans based at least on the availability and savings scores, and displays the ordered set in an electronic chart format.
