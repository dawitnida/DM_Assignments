METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MANAGING RECEIPTS . A method and system for managing receipts includes a process for managing receipts whereby when a user makes a purchase of a product and/or service, an electronic copy of the data on the purchase receipt is generated. The purchase receipt data is then assigned an identification code unique to the user to create user correlated purchase receipt data. The user correlated purchase receipt data is then transferred to a data storage device where the user correlated purchase receipt data is stored until needed. The user correlated purchase receipt data is then made accessible to the user, and/or an authorized agent for the user, as needed, by accessing the data on the data storage device through a user account.
