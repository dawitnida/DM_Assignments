Method for online health management . The invention disclosed herein is a method for online health management. The method is family centered with the family, the family's health care providers, and family's health insurance entities linked by computer for the sharing of information. The medical information stored in the online health management system database is available to authorized persons anytime, anywhere. Additionally, the online health management system evaluates the family health insurance and advises the family of the schedule of benefits available to them. In this way the family may use all of their benefits to promote good health rather than using the health benefits solely for the purpose of paying for treatment of medical problems when such exist. The online health management system periodically measures and tracks certain vital signs and then compares those vital signs to published standards of normality. The vital signs are averaged together and a health score is generated which advises the family and health care providers of risks to the patients health. The family can then institute treatment plans in conjunction with their health care providers to lessen the risks to their health. Improvement in the health score can be used as feedback to the family and health care provider that the treatment plan is effective.
