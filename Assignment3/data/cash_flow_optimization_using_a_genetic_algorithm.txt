Cash flow optimization using a genetic algorithm . A genetic algorithm determines a plan for payment of payment obligations in accounts payable of a finance account. The genetic algorithm operates to satisfy certain objectives, including maximizing the minimum daily cash on hand in the finance account. A genome population including a number of vectors is generated. The genome population is modified using a genetic algorithm, until at least one vector represents a plan for the payment obligations such that payment of each payment obligation in accordance with the vector most nearly satisfies one or more objectives.
