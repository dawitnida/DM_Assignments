DYNAMIC CONFIGURABLE TRANSACTION SYSTEM . The present invention relates to the field of electronic transactions and more particularly concerns a dynamic configurable transaction system capable of dynamically configuring a transaction terminal and dynamically processing a transactional operation, as well as to a method associated thereto. There is provided a dynamic configurable transaction system enabling a user to complete a transactional operation through a central server. The system comprises a transaction terminal in communication with the central server via a system network and a server application at the central server. The transaction terminal includes a user interface allowing to exchange input and output information related to the transactional operation with the user and a terminal application in communication with the user interface, the terminal application comprising updatable configuration parameters and a transaction module for dynamically building a transaction flow related to the transactional operation based on the input information received via the user interface and on the updatable configuration parameters. The server application comprises a configuration update module for preparing updated configuration parameters and transmitting the updated configuration parameters to the transaction terminal.
