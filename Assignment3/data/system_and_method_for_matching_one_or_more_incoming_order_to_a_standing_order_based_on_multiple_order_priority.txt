SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MATCHING ONE OR MORE INCOMING ORDER TO A STANDING ORDER BASED ON MULTIPLE ORDER PRIORITY . A method of order allocation is disclosed. The method includes receiving an incoming order, establishing an inner market representing a first portion of an order book which may be defined as a function of an inner market parameter, designating the first portion of the order book as a priority and allocating the first portion of the received incoming order based on the priority, establishing an outer market that represents a second portion of the order book that includes the remainder of the order book not represented by the inner market of the order book, assigning the received incoming order to one of the inner or outer markets as a function of the inner market parameter, allocating a first portion of the incoming order to the inner market utilizing a first-in, first-out (FIFO) algorithm, and allocating a second portion, in excess of the first portion, of the incoming order to the outer market using a pro-rata algorithm.
