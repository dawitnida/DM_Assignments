Automated soft limit control of electronic transaction accounts . "A system and method of providing one or more user selectable transaction limits (soft limit) for an associated account, generally within the constraints of fixed transaction limits for the account. The soft limit may be adjusted by the user in response to anticipated transaction volume to reduce fraudulent charge risk. By way of example, the soft limit remains at a low default transaction limit that is generally sufficient for covering daily expenditures when utilizing the account, and may be temporarily set to a higher limit by the user contemplating making a purchases which may exceed the soft limit. After a time period has elapsed or a given number of transactions have occurred after user selection of the soft limit it drops back to the default value. The inventive system and method may be practiced within or interfaced to ""card processing centers"" of transactions cards or other account tokens."
