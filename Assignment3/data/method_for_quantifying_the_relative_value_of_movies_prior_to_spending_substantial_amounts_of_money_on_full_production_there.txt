Method for quantifying the relative value of movies prior to spending substantial amounts of money on full production thereof . "This invention relates to methods for quantifying the relative value of a movie concept, script, treatment or other representation of a movie prior to spending substantial amounts of money on fully producing it. The decisions to make major investments in large budget movies and smaller investments in mid sized budget movies, and even to make what might be considered comparatively minor investments, such as by indie filmmakers--although not necessarily minor investments to the indie filmmakers--in what are small budget movies, are greatly enhanced by a method that allows for some quantitative feedback on the potential for success of a movie before the bulk of the investment in its full production is made. The present invention provides such methods, and does so through the use of ""investment trailers,"" or ""ITs"", a movie trailer that is different from ones used to promote a movie after it has been produced. The purpose of ITs is to create a vehicle, at a very low price, that can be placed on the internet for viewing. By monitoring various market metrics, such as the numbers of views for each IT, and collecting data on the market performance of those movies that are ultimately produced and distributed, one can create a basis for comparison with future movies to allow for data-supported predictions about the potential for success of a given movie, and do so very fast, very inexpensively and reasonably accurately."
