BUSINESS TO BUSINESS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS . In an aspect of the invention, a system and method are provided for facilitating short-term loans between businesses, secured against receivables. For example, if a business A owes a debt to business B, then A can lend money to B or to a third business C to whom B is in debt. Thus, a loan that defaults can be deducted from an existing debt. In another aspect, a system and method are providing for nullifying debt between businesses. For example, if business A owes an amount to business B and B owes to A, the smaller debt between the parties can be nullified, leaving one debt between A and B. In other implementations, a search can be performed for linking debts that allow a business A, for example, to nullify (or reduce) a given debt it owes to business Z.
