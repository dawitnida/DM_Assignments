Budgeting requirements model generator . A budget requirements model generator (BRMG) that determines budgeting requirements for a project across funding categories. The BRMG is organized in a hierarchical structure. The hierarchical structure is imposed on a budgetary process thereby providing uniform budgeting tools at all levels of an organization. A baseline budget is determined at a task level reflecting the costs of completing the task without regard to resource limitations. A constrained model run reflects the reality of limited resources. Constraints may be imposed on costs to produce a budgetary model that reflects a resulting readiness. Alternatively, constraints may be imposed on readiness to produce a resulting cost. Because all systems are analyzed using the same tools, decision makers can compare constrained budgetary models for all systems to determine objectively how budgetary allocations within an organization should be made.
