Reservoir Evaluation Methods . Described herein are methods of evaluating reservoirs. At least one of the methods includes providing a three dimensional reservoir framework having a plurality of cells; assigning one or more constant reservoir property values to some or all of the cells to provide a first three dimensional reservoir model; updating the first three dimensional reservoir model by populating some or all of the cells with one or more variable reservoir property values to provide a second three dimensional reservoir model; and updating the second three dimensional reservoir model by populating some or all of the cells with one or more reservoir property values derived from seismic data to provide a third three dimensional reservoir model. Other methods are also described.
