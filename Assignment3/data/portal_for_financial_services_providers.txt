Portal for financial services providers . A portal (1) facilitates electronic business communication between independent agents (3, 4) and connected financial services providers, i.e. for example terminals (2) of insurance firms etc. By means of a format conversion (18) by the portal (1) and a data transmission via the internet (10), all the data relevant to the preparation, arrangement and provision of a financial service, for example of insurance firms, are handled electronically. It is thus possible to substantially dispense with paper-based manual processing of data.
