Systems and methods for insuring intellectual property holding companies . A method is performed by an insurance transaction workstation for structuring an insurance transaction between an insured entity owning an intellectual property holding company (IPHC) and an insurer. The method includes receiving an insurance coverage request for protection against a loss based on a successful taxing authority challenge to tax benefits or value derived from the IPHC, calculating a probability of success of the taxing authority challenge, and identifying an intellectual property (IP) portfolio owned by the IPHC. The method further includes estimating a current value of IP assets in the identified IP portfolio and determining an insurance premium of an insurance policy based on the received insurance coverage, the calculated probability of success, and the current value of the IP assets.
