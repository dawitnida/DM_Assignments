Computer-Implemented Data Storage Systems And Methods For Use With Predictive Model Systems . Systems and methods for performing fraud detection. As an example, a system and method can be configured to contain a raw data repository for storing raw data related to financial transactions. A data store contains rules to indicate how many generations or to indicate a time period within which data items are to be stored in the raw data repository. Data items stored in the raw data repository are then accessed by a predictive model in order to perform fraud detection.
