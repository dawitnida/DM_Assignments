Agricultural transaction system involving non-agricultural inputs . The disclosure describes methods for performing agricultural transactions involving the exchange of inputs, such as agricultural equipment, non-equipment agricultural inputs, and non-agricultural inputs, in consideration of a commitment to deliver a specified quantity of an agricultural commodity over a specified period of time. In consideration of the commitment and, in some cases, a payment, the agricultural producer receives the inputs. In effect, the payment may result in a substantial discount of the price that the agricultural producer would otherwise pay for the inputs. The methods also may be applicable to exchange of non-agricultural commodities.
