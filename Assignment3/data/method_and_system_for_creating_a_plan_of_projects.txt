Method and System for Creating a Plan of Projects . A method of creating a plan of projects to invest in for an investment program. The investment program is for a period of time, for example 5 years. A plurality of investment projects are defined. Each investment project has at least one resource requirement (e.g. a project cost and/or an effort requirement). At least one project benefit score is determined for each investment project. The project benefit score for an investment project indicates the benefit of performing the investment project. Resource constraints are defined for the investment program. The resource constraints comprise for each of a plurality of sub-periods of time (e.g. particular years) within the period of time of the investment program, at least one resource constraint which constrains the resource available for investing in projects for the sub-period. The resource requirements, project benefit scores and resource constraints are provided as inputs to a risk reduction procedure which determines a plan for the investment program. The plan identifies for each sub-period of time particular investment projects to invest in. The risk reduction procedure is arranged to produce a plan which satisfies the resource constraints and reduces residual risk, the residual risk comprising the combined project benefit scores of unperformed investment projects.
