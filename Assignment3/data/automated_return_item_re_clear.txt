Automated return item re-clear . Automatically, electronically re-clearing returned checks for payment and presentment. A check processing entity includes a check processing system. A re-clear module of the check processing system receives electronic information regarding a check returned by a receiving institution. The re-clear module automatically determines whether the check is eligible for re-clearing, i.e., whether the check is eligible for reprocessing for payment and/or presentment. For example, the re-clear module can determine whether the check is eligible based on: (a) whether a depositing institution associated with the check has subscribed to a re-clearing service of the processing entity, (b) whether a value of the check is less than a threshold amount, (c) whether the check has been previously re-cleared, and/or (d) whether a reason why the receiving institution returned the check renders re-clearing undesirable. The check processing system can re-clear each returned check determined to be eligible for re-clearing.
