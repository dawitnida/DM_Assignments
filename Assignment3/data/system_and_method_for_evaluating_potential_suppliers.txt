System and method for evaluating potential suppliers . A method on a central information processing system evaluates financial health of suppliers of a business entity by checking a central repository to determine whether a current financial health report exists for a supplier and if not, determines whether criteria have been satisfied to require the supplier to purchase the financial health report without financial assistance from the business entity. Upon satisfaction of criteria, the method receives a first request from the supplier for information concerning requirements for becoming a supplier, sends the requested information to the supplier, upon the supplier approving the information, transfers a second request from the supplier to a financial health reporting service to have a supplier financial health report sent to the business entity at the supplier's expense, sends contact information of the business entity to the reporting service for automatic affiliation with the supplier request, and receives the report directly from the reporting service.
