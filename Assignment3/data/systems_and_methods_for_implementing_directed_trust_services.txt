Systems and methods for implementing directed trust services . A trust accounting system and securities broker platform are closely integrated such that a third-party investment manager is notified of an amount of principal cash that is available for investment. Investments made are reported to the trust accounting system. Information flow between the third-party investment manager and the trust accounting system occurs daily. Consequently, the operator of the trust accounting system, e.g., a bank, can perform its fiduciary oversight duty while maximizing return on investment of principal cash, and beneficiaries can obtain up-to-date information about the state of trust investments and income.
