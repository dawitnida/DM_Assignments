Pooling data for consumer credit or debit cards . A consumer data credit card or debit card or personal computer wallet linked to an Internet master catalogue of products. The consumer data card empowers the small credit card or debit cardholder against retailers, by mining and analyzing their consumer profile data, for anticipated purchases, and then leveraging the consumer's offers on specific products, for group discounts. It uses a new business method for pooling, options, and brokering dispersals of consumer's offers to retailers; via the Internet for price discounts. The consumer's card is encrypted as an origin code, for privacy, of their personal consumer profile data being dispersed. The master catalogue is linked via the Internet to remote computer display kiosks, at shopping and information stations, allowing for in-store display of discounts; geared to specific cardholders, and to facilitate in store shopping and checkout; by the personal computer wallet and allowing worldwide virtual shopping.
