Motor vehicle data collection system . A system and method for use in motor vehicle service facilities that deters theft of services. A motor vehicle is detected through the use of a cooperating pair of pressure sensors. The pressure sensors are positioned such that the tires of the motor vehicle roll over the pressure sensors as the motor vehicle enters a bay area for service work. A camera situated in the bay area is coupled with the sensors and takes a time-stamped photo of any motor vehicle that triggers the sensors. In order to reduce the number of false positive triggering events, the camera will only take a photo if both sensors are triggered within a predetermined time of one another. The photos are time-stamped and archived for later auditing purposes. The photos are used in conjunction with invoice data for services provided. A computer system reconciles the number of invoices against the number of photos. If a discrepancy is found, a comparison is made between the time-stamp on the invoices and the time-stamp on the photos. Photos without corresponding invoices are flagged for further investigation.
