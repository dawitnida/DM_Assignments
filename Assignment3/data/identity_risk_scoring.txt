Identity Risk Scoring . An identity risk score may be determined for subscribers of a service to indicate a level of confidence or certainty associated with a subscriber's identity. The identity risk score may be modified upward or downward in order to reflect changing levels of certainty. The changes may be based on transactions performed on behalf of and/or information submitted by the subscriber. Functionality provided to the subscriber may also be dependent upon whether the subscriber's identity risk score meets a threshold. In one or more arrangements, an identity risk score may be determined based on whether information entered by the subscriber can be confirmed and a level of confidence with which the information is confirmed.
