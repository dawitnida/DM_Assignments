Security issuer rights management process (SIRMP) and internet-based network for carrying out the same . An Internet-based method and system which inherently recognizes the separable, withholdable, and transferable rights associated with issuing equity, debt, and/or hybrid securities, thereby enabling the maximization of economic value that such property can support within a society. According to the method and system, the security rights that issuers of equity, debt and hybrid securities possess prior to structuring and issuance are unbundled (i.e. individually recognized and separated), allowing a security issuer to withhold from issuance, and retain, the ability to lend its security/securities or, to restructure and reissue its security/securities, and retain, the ability to lend its security/securities, in order to preclude, or to control and manage, short-selling of its securities. Currently, there is no mechanism by which companies, governments, or other entities can preclude or control short-selling once they issue securities.
