Computer software and system for automatic stock dealings . A computer readable medium is configured with instructions for causing a first computer system connected to a computer system of stock exchange market via a data communication network to automatically place a series of stock trade orders. The first computer system can include, for instance, a user computer, a brokerage computer, or both. An automated system for systematically and repeatedly placing stock trade orders based on predetermined conditions is also provided. In general, the automated system or computer system running the software operates by receiving and storing an automatic stock trading condition. A stock trading order can be placed immediately following a previously contracted order, or when a stock market status satisfies the preset stock trading condition. The first computer system preferably receives user input including basic information such as an item code of the stock and an account number of a stockholder. Automatic trade condition information can also be input into the first computer system by the user or a broker and preferably provides information for determining a desired selling price and quantity and/or a desired purchasing price and quantity for trading of the stock. Market data, preferably including the stock price is received into the first computer system via the data communication network, such as from the stock exchange market computer system. The first computer system can then determine whether a stock purchase or sale condition generated using the automatic trade condition information has been met and place a stock purchase or sale order via the data communication network when the stock purchase or sale condition is met. This system can systematically repeat the process using the automatic trade condition information as a guide for trading. The process can be repeated continuously or can be stopped when a predetermined condition is satisfied.
