Automated loan processing system and method for processing loans . A method for managing loan processing workflow includes a workflow of a logical sequence of interdependent tasks to be performed to complete processing of a loan from initial input to closing. The workflow has tasks and notifications. Each task has an associated status, either resolved or not resolved. Related tasks and notifications are grouped into sets. The workflow tasks are displayed in a logical order and upon satisfaction of predetermined conditions. At least one of the displayed tasks requires input from a user to set the status and a user changes the status of the task to resolved. One or more notifications linked to certain of the workflow tasks are output and do not require input from a user. A loan application is processed through the workflow. All tasks can require resolved status before displaying the next one and each can require input from a user.
