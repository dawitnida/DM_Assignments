Apparatus And Method For Payment Card Account Personalization . Techniques for payment card account personalization include obtaining access to data describing a first set of parameters associated with the payment card account and obtaining indications of a first change in a life situation of an account holder. The first change may be one that has occurred since establishment of the first set of parameters. Presentation of a first menu of updated parameter choices to the holder is facilitated. The presentation of the first menu can be based upon the first change in the life situation of the holder. A holder selection can be obtained from the first menu, including data describing a second set of parameters associated with the payment card account, the second set of parameters being different than the first set of parameters. The payment card account then operates according to the second set of parameters. In some instances, account parameters can be updated across multiple financial institutions, by a service provider.
