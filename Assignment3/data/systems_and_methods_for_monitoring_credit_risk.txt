Systems and methods for monitoring credit risk . Methods and systems for evaluating credit risk are provided. Following underwriting approval, merchants receive credit authorization from a credit issuing entity and initiate operation. Thereafter, circumstances may result in increased credit risk to the credit issuing entity. According to the present invention, the transaction history for each merchant is recorded. Periodically, the transaction history is evaluated for credit risk and merchants may be selected for credit risk review. A merchant is selected from a list of merchants to be reviewed and one or more analyses are performed to evaluate the degree of risk imposed by the merchant. Additional information may also be collected relating to the merchant. Based on the evaluation and the additional information, modifications may be made to the manner in which future credit risk is determined for the merchant. A decision tree may be used to collect the additional information and perform the analyses.
