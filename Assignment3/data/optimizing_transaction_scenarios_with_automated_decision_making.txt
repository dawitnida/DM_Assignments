Optimizing Transaction Scenarios With Automated Decision Making . An example computer-implemented method of processing transactions in a funds facilitation system includes the steps of: receiving an electronic funding request to provide a payment for a transaction; identifying characteristics of the transaction based on information provided in the funding request; comparing the characteristics of the transaction with transaction rules stored in a rules database to determine at least one of: (a) a payment source for funding the funding request, and (b) an authentication procedure for authorizing the funding request. The selection of the authentication procedure is based at least in part on a stored trust level associated with a source of the electronic funding request. The receiving, identifying, and comparing steps are performed by software executable on one or more data processors. A funds facilitation system and memory structure are also included.
