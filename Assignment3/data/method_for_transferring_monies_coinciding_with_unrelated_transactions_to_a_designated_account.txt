Method for transferring monies, coinciding with unrelated transactions, to a designated account . A method to increase savings by individuals based upon a percentage or portion of transactions made. In its most basic form, the method allows the participant to elect to have a small amount added to the charge for each non-cash transaction. The method of the present invention incorporates the calculation of a small, savings amount based upon the amount of a qualified transaction. The savings amount is added to the transaction amount to give a total amount for the participant's accounting and statement purposes, but it is not incorporated into the transaction payment. Instead, it is split off and transferred to a designated account that the participant chooses. Additionally, the financial institution, retailer, or other business entities involved in the transaction may elect to make some form of matching contribution to the participant's account as a form of promotion. The present invention benefits the participant by transferring small amounts from a highly used account to an account that the participant intends to use for saving purposes. Such an account may be any account chosen by the participant, but will generally be a savings type account, retirement account, an account that the participant has set aside to build up funds for a particular purpose, or an altruistic type account, such as a college fund for a child.
