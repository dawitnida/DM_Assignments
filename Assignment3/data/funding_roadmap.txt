Funding Roadmap . A proprietary software program written in My SQL and PHP derived originally from a precedent functional model built/programmed in Microsoft Excel's underlying Visual Basic Application (VBA) program. Also an interactive multimedia format and online secure web server platform built to embed the software program in virtual space. This combined software programming and internet-based technology allows for the new proprietary features such as the hyperlinked navigation, streaming video presentation component, self-populating and linked formula text and numerical data fields, multiple choice drop down menus, multi-preparer collaboration from remote separate locations, licensable access, automatic preparation of sophisticated analysis reports, check boxes that trigger colored markers, compliance alert color alarms tied to responses, online deal flow networking and report presentation sharing, and other features not possible with existing available business plan reports or software.
