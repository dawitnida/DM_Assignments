Source data is retrieved from one or more data sources of a remote data server on which the source data is stored, the source data including transactions for a specific date and identification of the entity and account that each transaction is associated with. A metrics summary packet is generated for a particular account and the specific date, the metrics summary packet including one or more transaction classifiables that satisfy a predefined set of metric definition rules. A subjects packet is generated for the particular account that identifies the entities associated with the particular account, and a subjects-metrics packet is generated for the particular account by combining subject classifiables and metric classifiables within the subjects packet and metric summary packet. An aggregation packet is generated for an entity associated with the particular account, the aggregation packet including subject and metric classifiables of the subjects-metrics packet that satisfy a predefined set of aggregation rules. An evaluation score is generated for the entity by passing classifiables of the aggregation packet through a rules engine including a predefined set of scenario rules to determine if the aggregation classifiables are indicative of suspicious financial activity. A work item is generated if the evaluation score is indicative of suspicious financial activity.
