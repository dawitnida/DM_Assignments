Financial information input method using symmetrical key security algorithm and commercial transaction system for mobile communications . A financial information input method using a symmetric key security algorithm and a mobile communications commercial transaction system using the same encrypts financial information such as a customer's identification number and a valid date with a symmetric key algorithm by use of an electronic wallet administration number of a customer's terminal used as an encryption key at the time of applying an issuance of a card, and directly inputs the encrypted financial information into a customer's electronic wallet terminal or inputs the same via a communications network. In the case that a commercial transaction settlement is accomplished with a mobile communications terminal in which the encrypted financial information is stored, his or her own electronic wallet administration number is input so that the encrypted financial information and the administration number are optically transmitted to a POS terminal/card inquiry machine of an affiliated shop. The POS terminal/card inquiry machine which has received the encrypted financial information and administration number uses the received electronic wallet administration number and decodes the encrypted financial information with the administration number. Thus, although an unauthorized person knows an encryption algorithm unless a customer's electronic wallet administration number is exposed illegally, customer's financial information cannot be used. That is, an effect of fundamentally preventing customer's financial information from being illegally copied can be provided.
