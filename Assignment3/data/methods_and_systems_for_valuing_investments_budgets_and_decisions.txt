METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR VALUING INVESTMENTS, BUDGETS AND DECISIONS . A computer implemented method of making a decision through modeling comprising the steps of: providing a first decision having at least one future cash flow on a computer; providing at least one image to a user from a library of images; selecting an image for each future cash flow to represent uncertainty of magnitude to provide at least one magnitude distribution; selecting an image of distribution for each future cash flow to represent uncertainty at least one particular time providing at least one timing distribution; combining the magnitude distribution and the timing distribution into a joint-probability distribution function; plotting the joint-probability function to provide a probability texture; accepting modifications; accepting information about a relationship between possible future events; converting at least two joint-probability functions to generate a two-dimensional net present value probability distribution; accepting modifications to joint-probability functions and re-generating a two-dimensional net present value probability distribution.
