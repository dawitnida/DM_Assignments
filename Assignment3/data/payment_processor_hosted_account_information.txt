Payment Processor Hosted Account Information . A payment processor may host account information such as an account number of a customer provided during a transaction with a point of sale of a merchant. The account information may be received by the payment processor without being stored at the point of sale. For example, the account information may be received by the payment processor via a web page that may emulate a terminal at the point of sale. The payment processor may store the account information and may establish a unique transaction identifier for the transaction. The unique identifier may be provided to the customer with a receipt and the account number may be provided to an entity that may provide payment the merchant to complete the sales transaction.
