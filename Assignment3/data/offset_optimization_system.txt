OFFSET OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM . Systems, methods, and computer program products are provided for optimizing amounts collected in an offset action where a creditor garnishes funds from a debtor's deposits account to satisfy delinquent debt payments. In operation, embodiments of the present invention leverage a deposits account's transaction history to detect a deposit pattern for the account and, based on the detected pattern, predict the date of the next large deposit to the garnishable account. An offset associate, using the present invention, can then schedule the offset action to occur on the expected date of the next large deposit.
