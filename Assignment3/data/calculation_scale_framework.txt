Calculation scale framework . The present invention provides a method of providing a reusable calculation scale framework. The reusable framework may be used in an electronic commerce environment. The electronic commerce environment defines a calculation rule and a set of commerce objects. Typically, the commerce objects are line items in invoices, purchase orders or other commercial documents or records generated in connection with web-based transactions. The method comprises steps of providing a calculation scale look up interface, a range look up result interface, a multiplication product of the results returned by the two interfaces, an apportioned monetary value for each of the commerce objects. The method is particularly useful in implementations for determining weighted shipping charges, discounts and taxes in various commercial environments. The environments may include a variety of calculation rules based on the circumstances in the commercial environment. The invention also provides a computer product for implementing the various methods. The computer product includes a recording medium such as a magnetic floppy disk, CD-ROM, hard drive or other suitable means. The products and methods are particularly useful in association with web-based commercial software applications. The methods and products provide a calculation scale framework which may be reused to avoid programming changes despite frequent, and often significant, changes in commercial environments.
