Metadata-driven statistics processing . A method for generating statistical information for performance management reporting is provided. Raw statistical information provided by managed data network equipment is described in a body of vendor data network equipment specific metadata--the collection of which is referred to as vendor statistics metadata. The statistical information needed for performance reporting is described in a body of performance reporting metadata. The method has a sequence of steps. In an initial syntactic translation step, the vendor statistics metadata is used to transform raw statistical information provided by managed data network equipment into a common format removing vendor dependencies while maintaining vendor semantics. In a second semantic extraction step, the statistical information for performance reporting is extracted in accordance to specifications described in a body of statistics semantic mapping metadata from a body of common format statistic information in accordance with prespecified preferences. This method of generating statistical information for performance management reporting enables faster integration of new vendor equipment in managed data network segments, faster integration of new services, faster integration of upgrades, etc.
