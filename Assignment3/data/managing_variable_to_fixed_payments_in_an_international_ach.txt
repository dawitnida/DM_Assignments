Managing variable to fixed payments in an International ACH . "Managing foreign payments in an International ACH. An originating depository financial institution (""ODFI"") can create an ACH item designating a fixed amount of foreign currency to be credited to, or a fixed amount of domestic currency to be debited from, a receiving depository financial institution. In a variable to fixed payment, a conversion module of the ODFI or a gateway operator can determine a foreign exchange (""FX"") conversion rate. Using the FX conversion rate, the conversion module can calculate a domestic currency amount or a foreign currency amount corresponding to the desired foreign/domestic currency payment. The conversion module can enter the FX conversion rate and/or the determined domestic/foreign currency amount into the ACH item for processing via the International ACH. In a fixed to fixed payment, the ODFI can transmit information about the foreign currency payment via the International ACH and settle the payment via ACH or non-ACH means."
