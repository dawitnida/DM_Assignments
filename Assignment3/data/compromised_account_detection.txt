Compromised Account Detection . Systems and methods are disclosed for identifying a compromised account. A compromised account may be identified by identifying a first unique identifier and associating the unique identifier with a fraud behavior. A second unique identifier may be identified and associated with a fraud behavior as well. The first unique identifier and the second unique identifier may be linked if at least a portion of the fraud behavior of the first unique identifier corresponds to at least a portion of the fraud behavior of the second unique identifier. Information relating to the fraud behavior of the first unique identifier, information relating to the fraud behavior of the second unique identifier, and information relating to the link between the fraud behavior of the first unique identifier and the second unique identifier may be stored in a data file. The first and/or the second unique identifiers may be an Internet protocol address.
