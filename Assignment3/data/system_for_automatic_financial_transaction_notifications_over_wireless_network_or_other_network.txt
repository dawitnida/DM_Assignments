System for automatic financial transaction notifications over wireless network or other network . In a method and system for automatically notifying a user when financial transactions (e.g., debit card transactions and credit card transactions) are carried out in association with the user's credit card or other financial account, each time a financial transaction is completed, a notification message is generated and transmitted to a user-designated terminal. Examples include transmitting e-mails, other text messages, or audio messages to the user's home computer terminal or mobile phone or other wireless unit. The notification message contains information identifying the user account and specifying the nature of the transaction, such as monetary amount, time of day and date, and where the transaction occurred. The notification is generated and transmitted substantially immediately after the transaction is completed. This way, a user is informed of each transaction separately and substantially contemporaneously with when the transaction is carried out, allowing users to intuitively assess the transaction from a time sense.
