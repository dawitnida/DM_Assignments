Generating an annuity payment using a dynamic asset allocation investment . An annuity is provided to an annuitant based on the performance of an investment. Assets of the investment are automatically reallocated over time and the annuity payment may change based on the performance of the automatically allocated assets. In some examples, the assets are automatically reallocated based on a demographic, which can include an age, a range of ages, and/or a gender.
