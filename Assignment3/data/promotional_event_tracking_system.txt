Promotional event tracking system . This invention relates to the methods of coordinating and tracking product and service demonstrations. An event coordinator directs event operators to conduct a product or service demonstration event. The event coordinator provides event operators with cards, such as debit cards, credit cards, or smart cards, to purchase items needed for the demonstration. The event operator contacts a card administration system to activate the card. The card administration system verifies that the provided card ID and event ID are valid, and associates an authorized budget of the demonstration event with the card. The event operator then purchases items with the card, and conducts demonstrations. Event data is provided to the parties involved in the demonstration such as a product manufacturer or service provider, the event coordinator, a staffing agency, the event operator, and a retail store. The event data includes, for example, items purchased for demonstration using the card, items purchased by customers during the demonstrations, and time information.
