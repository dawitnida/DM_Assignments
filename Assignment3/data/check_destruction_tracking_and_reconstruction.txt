CHECK DESTRUCTION TRACKING AND RECONSTRUCTION . A method for check destruction tracking and reconstruction relates to tracking the destruction of financial institution items, such as paper checks. The method includes transferring the financial institution items to a bin for transporting the items to be destroyed. The bin is associated with a bin identifier. The items which are in the bin are identified and the bin is transported for destruction. If the items are safely transported and safely destroyed, a notification of destruction of the items in the bin is sent. If the items are either not safely transported or not safely destroyed, a notification of an incident is sent. Appropriate action may be taken in response to receiving such notification.
