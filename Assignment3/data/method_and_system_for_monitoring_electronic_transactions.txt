Method and system for monitoring electronic transactions . "A method and system for monitoring electronic transactions, such as credit card transactions, to determine whether associated transaction costs, such as interchange fees, are being properly qualified. This is accomplished by monitoring for a ""spike"" in interchange qualifications and generating an alert when one or more spikes are detected. Spikes in interchange qualifications are defined as a variation in interchange qualifications compared with an historical level. The method and system may also monitor changes in cost or efficiency for other types of transactions in which the cost or efficiency of the transaction is based directly upon one or more variables."
