Method and system for facilitating analysis of risks . A method and system for facilitating analysis of risks. Items, families of items, risks, sub-categories of risks, and categories of risks are weighted. Items are related to each other by a common business function. The risks are associated with each item. For each item, each associated risk is evaluated to determine whether the risk is mitigated. Risk ratings associated with the items or families are calculated using at least risk evaluations and weights assigned to risks and items. The risk ratings are summarized in selectable views which are based on the sub-categories or categories, and which are to be analyzed by wide-ranging levels in a business organizational hierarchy.
