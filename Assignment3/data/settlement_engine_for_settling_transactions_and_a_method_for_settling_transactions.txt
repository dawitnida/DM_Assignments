Settlement engine for settling transactions and a method for settling transactions . Summarising, the present invention aims to provide a more efficient settlement engine requiring less computation effort and processing time. This is accomplished by establishing a total priority list of all transactions. The received transaction data to be settled are step-wisely transferred to an intermediate table storing the transaction data of highest priority for each security type, and transferring the transaction data of highest priority from the intermediate storage to the final total priority list.
