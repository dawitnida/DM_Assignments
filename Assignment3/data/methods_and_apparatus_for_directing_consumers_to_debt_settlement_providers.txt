Methods and Apparatus for Directing Consumers to Debt Settlement Providers . A consumer having a delinquent loan is directed to a debt settlement provider by a data processing system comprising a data processor in signal communication with a memory. Initially, the data processing system obtains a credit report for the consumer reflecting at least a portion of the consumer's credit history. The data processing system then determines the delinquent loan of the consumer directly from this credit report. Finally, the data processing system transmits information about the consumer and the delinquent loan to the debt settlement provider.
