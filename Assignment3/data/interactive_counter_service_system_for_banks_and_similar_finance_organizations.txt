Interactive counter service system for banks and similar finance organizations . An interactive counter service system for banks and similar finance organizations mainly includes a touch-screen module, a counter-terminal module, and network communicating equipment. The touch-screen module is mounted at counters of the banks to serve as an interface via which a customer may select one or more desired transactions provided by the bank and input required data via a magnetic strip reader or a card reader of the touch-screen module. The counter-terminal module enables a counter clerk to synchronously receive and process the data input by the customer and provide on-line business consultation to help the customer to complete the selected transaction. The interactive counter service system effectively improves the interactive relation between the customer and the bank and thereby upgrades the service quality of the bank.
