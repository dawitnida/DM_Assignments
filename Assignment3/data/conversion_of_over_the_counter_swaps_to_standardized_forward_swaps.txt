CONVERSION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAPS TO STANDARDIZED FORWARD SWAPS . Systems, processes and methods are described for converting over-the-counter derivative products such as interest rate swaps (IRSs) to standardized forward swaps, such as centrally cleared interest rate swaps. The value of each leg of the over-the counter swap may be determined and compared to a value of a corresponding leg of the forward swap. A mark-to-market value may be determined as the difference between the values.
