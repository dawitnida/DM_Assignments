Graphical Representation of Financial Transactions . A statement generator allows financial institutions to present transaction information as a graphical representation to an account holder in, for example, a statement of purchases. The statement generator obtains transaction information associated with an account holder and maps the transaction information to correlate the transaction information with at least one parameter. The transaction information can include at least one of a purchase amount, a purchase location, a purchase time, or a purchase category. The at least one parameter includes at least one of a purchase location, a purchase time, a purchase amount, or a purchase category. The statement generator depicts the mapping to the account holder to identify a correlation between transactions. The depiction can be a print out of the mapping or the mapping can be rendered on a display.
