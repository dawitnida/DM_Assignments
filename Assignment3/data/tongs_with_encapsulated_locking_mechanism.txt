Tongs with encapsulated locking mechanism . A pair of locking kitchen tongs for use in handling food items and the like is disclosed. The tongs have a pair of rigid steel arms each having a workpiece engaging or grasping end, a body portion and a pivot end from which the arms are pivotally connected together. The grasping ends are preferably scalloped along one edge, for handling relatively large items, and serrated (i.e., fine-toothed) along another edge, for handling of smaller or fine items. A bulbous, tear-shaped body made from a rigid, non-metal material encapsulates the pivot ends of the two arms as they are pivotally connected together to permit movement between an open position and a closed position. Also within and coupled to the encapsulating body is a sliding locking plate. The locking plate has a body defining a slot which allows the locking plate to slide between a locked position, maintaining the arms in their closed position, and an unlocked position, allowing them free pivoting movement.
