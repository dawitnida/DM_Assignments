CHARTING WITH DEPTH OF MARKET VOLUME FLOW . Systems and methods are described for generating depth of market (DOM) volume flow charts. According to various embodiments, the DOM volume of a financial instrument is monitored. The DOM volume can include volume elements corresponding to bid order volume and/or ask order volume of orders for the financial instrument that are open on an electronic exchange. A DOM volume flow may then be computed, according to some embodiments, by evaluating a function of one or more elements of the DOM volume and/or a change in the DOM volume elements. Then, indicators of the computed DOM volume flow may be displayed on a chart.
