AUTOMATED REVIEW AND HOLD PLACEMENT . A method for automated processing of deposit items at a computing device is described. A deposit item, such as case, a personal check, or certified check, is received at a computing device. The deposit item may represent a request to deposit funds of at least one monetary item into a user account, such as a checking or savings account. A computer associated with the computing device determines whether to hold the funds of the at least one monetary item from deposit into the user account. If it is determined to hold the funds, an amount of the funds to hold and a time period in which to hold the amount of funds may be determined.
