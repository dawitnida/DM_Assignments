Method of capitalizing a bank or bank holding company . The present invention is directed to a method of capitalizing a bank holding company by, for example, providing a capital structure for the bank holding company that includes multiple tranches of one or more series of common stock, each tranche corresponding to one of a number of classes of ownership rights in the bank holding company. Each share of common stock associated with one or more of the tranches will have a capped dividend paid out at a predetermined rate whose value is dependent on the particular one of the tranches that the share of common stock is associated with.
