Systems and method for improving investment performance . Methods for a data processor implemented system monitor for enabling persons to turn over the allocation of their investment assets, and/or receive assistance concerning how to receive disbursements from investments, in a manner that is free from or ameliorates the traditional conflicts of interest in previous systems. The systems and methods are adapted to ameliorate the tension between other functions where the compensation may be affected by asset allocation. The systems and methods collect, monitor, and direct information from persons who hold indicative data, e.g., employers, to provide professional asset allocation services, including automatic allocation, rebalancing, and reallocation of investment assets, on a regular basis; as well as assistance in determining how much to save or how to receive disbursements in a manner that ameliorates conflicts of interest, which, in the case of employee benefit plans, is consistent with the regulatory restraints of ERISA.
