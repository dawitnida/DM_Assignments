PAY YOURSELF FIRST WITH COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE . The system determines a community recommendation based upon community knowledge. The users consider the community recommendation when the users determine the largest amounts possible to pay to themselves, even if they are not able to fully pay outstanding debts. The system obtains information related to the user's income, income sources, user's debts (e.g., bills) and user's goals. The system provides recommendations related to the prioritization of paying certain bills and the amount to pay for each bill based upon, for example, savings goals, the community recommendation, minimizing penalties/fees associated with user's debts, minimum amounts due, due dates and available income. The system and/or the user may then determine a payment hierarchy which includes transferring funds to the user's savings account prior to paying all or a portion of certain bills, wherein the transfer of funds may include different funds transfer systems and methods.
