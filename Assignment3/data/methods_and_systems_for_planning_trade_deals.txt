Methods and systems for planning trade deals . Methods and systems consistent with the present invention provide for planning deals. A deal master module provides a user interface for users to create a record with information reflecting characteristics of a first deal for inclusion in a deal hierarchy, and create a record with information reflecting characteristics of a second deal for inclusion in the deal hierarchy. The deal master module may form the deal hierarchy using the records by assigning a hierarchical relationship between the records for the first deal and the second deal. One of the deals is considered a top-level deal in the hierarchical relationship, and the other one of the deals is considered a sub-deal in the hierarchical relationship. The deal master module may thereafter make deal information available to a user to develop a potential trade promotion to promote one or more products or services, the deal information being derived from the deal hierarchy.
