SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FINANCIAL DATA MANAGEMENT AND COMPUTATION . A system and method for financial data management and computation is disclosed. In one embodiment, the system includes a financial storage module storing financial properties values, a metagraph module storing at least one sub-metagraph, a computation module, a metagraph complier module operatively coupled to the financial storage module, the metagraph module and the computation module, wherein the complier module is operatively configured to: (a) receive one or more financial entity groups, each having at least one group criterion, the financial entity group being associated with at least one sub-metagraph; (b) obtain financial data from the financial storage module (c) relate the financial data with at least one of the financial entity groups if the financial data complies with the group criterion thereby giving rise to at least one relevant financial entity groups (d) obtain sub-metagraphs associated with the relevant financial entity groups from the metagraph module giving rise to relevant sub-metagraphs (e) derive execution graphs from the relevant sub-metagraphs and (f) send the execution graphs for execution in the computation module, whereby financial information is updated and financial actions are performed according to the financial data.
