NAVIGATION THROUGH COMPONENTS . This disclosure provides various embodiments of software for navigating through components. In one aspect, the software associates a transactional process with a first component, triggers navigation from the first component to a second component, and performs the transactional process associated with the first component upon triggering navigation from the first component to the second component. In some implementations, the transactional process comprises validating modifications made to the data of the first component. In other implementations, the transactional process further comprises saving the modifications to the data of the first component if the validation is successful, and if the validation is unsuccessful, not saving the modifications to the data of the first component.
