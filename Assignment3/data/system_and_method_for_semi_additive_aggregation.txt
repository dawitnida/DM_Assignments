System and method for semi-additive aggregation . A simple interface may be provided that enables the user to define parameters for aggregation of a semi-additive measure. The interface may enable the user to designate a measure as a semi-additive measure and to pair the measure with an additive aggregation function. The interface may also enable the user to select non-additive dimensions and to pair each non-additive dimension with a corresponding aggregation function. One such aggregation function is a by account aggregation function, which enables each account in an account dimension to be aggregated across a corresponding non-additive dimension according to an associated account type.
