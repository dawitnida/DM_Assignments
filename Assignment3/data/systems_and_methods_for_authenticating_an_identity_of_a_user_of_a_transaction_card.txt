SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AUTHENTICATING AN IDENTITY OF A USER OF A TRANSACTION CARD . An input device associated with a user and an issuer computer system associated with an issuer are coupled to an interchange computer system associated with a network interchange. The interchange computer system is configured to authenticate an identity of a user of a transaction card as a legitimate cardholder. More specifically, the interchange computer system is configured to receive a registration request from the user using the input device wherein the registration request includes an account number or a name associated with the transaction card, generate an authentication message in response to the registration request, transmit the authentication message to an issuer of the transaction card wherein the issuer provides the authentication message to the user, and receive the authentication message from the user entering the authentication message into the input device to authenticate the identity of the user as the legitimate cardholder.
