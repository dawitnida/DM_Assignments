Rollover solutions . An apparatus for and a method of an electronic middleware interface consisting of communication interfaces designed to transfer data between financial record keeping systems and new account opening applications is presented. A retirement savings plan (RSP) administrator computer server communicates via the electronic middleware communication interfaces to a Rollover Solutions Network (RSN) application computer server to communicate financial savings plan participant data. The RSN application computer server utilizes the participant data to contact a financial service provider (FSP) computer server to identify the participant retirement accounts for rollover purposes. Alternatively, the RSN application computer server can contact the FSP computer server to open a new retirement account. Utilizing either the established retirement account or the new retirement account the RSN application computer server instructs the RSP administrator computer server to initiate rollover of the participants retirement account funds to the FSP.
