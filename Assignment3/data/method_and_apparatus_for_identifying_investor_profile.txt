Method and apparatus for identifying investor profile . An investor profiling process (200) presents (210) an investor with an investment environment and provides (225) investible assets. Several (240) time periods over a year are simulated during which the investor is provided updated status of his investment and additional information (230). In each time period the investor has the opportunity to reallocate (235) his investible assets. The reallocation data is later analyzed (245) to determined asset value protection (AVP) and income versus growth (IVG) characteristics of the investor. The AVP and IVG of the investor are then used to identify (250) an investor profile from a variety of predefined investor profiles. FIG. 2 accompanies the abstract.
