Digital content subscription conditioning system . Allocating subscription revenue may involve receiving usage information relating to usage of digital content (e.g., music, movies, text, images, games) in a digital content aggregation, identifying a coefficient relating to a subset of digital works in the digital content aggregation (e.g., author-specific subjective or objective factors, popularity ranking, historical factors, performance factors, etc.), and generating a revenue allocation for the digital content based on the coefficient and the usage information.
