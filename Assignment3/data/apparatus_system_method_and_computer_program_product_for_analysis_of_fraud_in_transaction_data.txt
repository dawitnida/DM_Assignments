Apparatus, System, Method and Computer Program Product for Analysis of Fraud in Transaction Data . In one non-limiting aspect thereof the exemplary embodiments of this invention provide a computer-implemented method to make a decision as to whether a particular claim submitted by a first economic agent for approval by a second economic agent may be a fraudulent claim. The method includes applying statistics to information representing a proxy of fraud to generate an estimate of a probability of fraud for the particular claim; updating the estimate of the probability of fraud using decision making under uncertainty that is based at least in part on at least one type of additional information; applying game theory to the updated estimate of the probability of fraud to model strategic behavior between the first and second economic agents; and generating a recommendation to audit or not audit the particular claim. The proxy of fraud may be imperfect proxy of fraud, such as is found in nascent industries.
