Distributed computing . Protects a highly confidential parameter against leakage in a distributed computing system. An example distributed computing system causing a plurality of partial calculations to be performed includes parameter storage for storing a parameter set having a plurality of parameters, conversion means for converting a linear parameter, sending means for sending each of converted parameter sets in association with parameter identifying information for identifying the parameter set to cause each of a plurality of calculation processing devices to perform each of a plurality of partial calculations, conversion ratio storage means for storing a conversion ratio of a parameter, conversion ratio searching means for searching for a conversion ratio corresponding to a parameter identifying information, and inversion outputting means for generating a partial calculation result by multiplying a calculation result by an inverse number of the conversion ratio and for outputting a set of the partial calculation results.
