Processing Cashless Transactions of Remote Field Assets . A field asset for use in a machine to machine environment that includes a plurality of field assets in communication with a remote transaction processing server may comprise a card reader and an extended function adapter (EFA). The card reader may detect a cashless payment card presented to the card reader and the EFA may facilitate a cashless transaction in response to presentment of the cashless payment card to the card reader. The EFA may be operable to locally authorize the cashless transaction based on locally stored transaction information if said field asset lacks connectivity to the remote transaction processing server and may further be operable to remotely authorize the cashless transaction based on remotely stored transaction information if the field asset has connectivity to the remote transaction processing server.
