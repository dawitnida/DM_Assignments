Investment Structure and Method Having Fixed and Contingent Components . An investment structure and method including a fixed component and a contingent component for investing funds. The fixed component invests a portion of the funds in fixed income securities and generates principal plus fixed interest. The contingent component invests another portion of the funds in non-fixed income investments and generates contingent interest. The fixed interest is selectively distributed or re-invested in the fixed component, and the contingent interest is re-invested in the contingent component in order to boost the trading pool for that component and potentially increase the return on investment. One or more limited partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations or other limited liability entities invests the contingent component.
