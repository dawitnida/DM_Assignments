Financial transfer simulation system and method . A financial transfer simulator program of the present invention provides an easy-to-use, visible, dynamic application for simulating a predefined set of financial transfers. The user can describe the set of financial transfers through graphical icons and simple input forms for parameters, without being concerned about how a financial transfer amount or stream of financial transfer amounts is calculated. The assumptions of the financial model are described explicitly in accessible, easily-changed graphical models, where the relationships between financial transfers are portrayed in terms of sequence, time, and flow of control. In one embodiment, a financial transfer simulator program is provided that is capable, when executed by a computer, of performing the following acts. Initially, it provides to a user a user interface for receiving a financial transfer model instance. It provides command options to the user to allow it to specify simulation parameters and edit the model instance. It also displays to the user results of the simulation upon request from the user.
