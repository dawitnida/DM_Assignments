CARDLESS CHALLENGE SYSTEMS AND METHODS . Systems, methods, and apparatus for handling and/or authorizing payment requests by a consumer for a transaction are provided. Challenge questions may be presented from the non-merchant to the consumer after receiving the payment information, thereby allowing a judicious determination of when to ask such challenge questions and allowing complex and probative questions. The time limit for such challenge questions may advantageously be unconstrained, while still preserving security. Also, a risk analysis may be started prior to the consumer submitting payment information, thus allowing an efficient and complex risk analysis. Information about an access device used by the consumer may be obtained at the non-merchant from the access device with code sent to the access device from the merchant, and the device information may be used in the risk analysis.
