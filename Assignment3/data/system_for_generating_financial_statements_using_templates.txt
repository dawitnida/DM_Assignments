System for generating financial statements using templates . In a computerized accounting system, a method of generating a financial report includes displaying a user-configurable chart template to a user of the system via a user-interface, receiving inputs into the chart template to define rows of information to be included in the report, the inputs include header/total pairs and detail lines. Rules associated with each detail line determine what accounts will be included in the report and how they are arranged. Rules may be based on a range of account codes, with each account having its own account code. Rules may also be based on a filter of account criteria associated with each account. Validation of the template ensures that accounts are not include twice in the same report and that no accounts are inadvertently overlooked.
