Foreign Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Hybrid Trust Strategy . Rubinstein & Rubinstein, LLP has developed a new, tax compliant invention which allows a U.S. taxpayer who is an employee of an entity based in a foreign jurisdiction, and/or the Employee's family, to minimize taxation on distributions from a foreign non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The strategy applies to foreign entities that have established deferred compensation plans for U.S. employees in compliance with IRS rules and regulations. The invention differs from generic deferred compensation plans because it allows a U.S. person to attain the benefits of participating in a deferred compensation plan all while maintaining minimized taxation on distributions from the plan.
