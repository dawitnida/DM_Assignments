System and method for creation and trade of exchange-backed equity investments . Transactions are performed between owners of unique financial instruments, Digital Objects (DOs), issued by an exchange company. Owners of DOs are entitled equity in the exchange company where said equity is generated through operations related to the trade of said DOs. User terminals communicate with a computer system that manages all transactions of the DOs between DO owners. DOs are organized in DO Groups which contain subsets of DO Classes containing arrays of DOs. The amount of exchange company equity that is entitled to each DO is determined based upon the DO Class to which the DO belongs. Equity entitlement is allocated to a DO as a function of relative non-economic performance of an Independent Variable Feature (IVF), which could represent third-party entities, markets, events or conditions wherein the performance is not a function of economic performance of the exchange company. Each DO Class is linked to a particular IVF.
