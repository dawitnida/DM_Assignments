Automated system for assisting employees to comply with filing requirements . An automated system and method for assisting federal employees and their managers to comply with regulations relating to filing financial disclosure forms. A program site is established on a computer network accessed by a computer terminal. The program site has databases listing employees and their managers, collections of notices that can be sent to employees and managers, collections of completed data forms, an assistance program that guides employees through a series of computer screens and that requires data to be entered correctly before the forms can be completed, a database of assets and prohibited assets, and a database of those employees that have failed to complete the forms or who possess prohibited assets, or both. The compliance program periodically reviews the database of non-compliant employees and employees with prohibited assets and transmits notices to employees and managers to insure compliance.
