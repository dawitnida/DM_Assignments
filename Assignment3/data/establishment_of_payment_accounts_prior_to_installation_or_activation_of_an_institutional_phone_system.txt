Establishment of Payment Accounts Prior to Installation or Activation of An Institutional Phone System . A method of establishing inmate telephone system payment accounts generally includes: identifying an institution in which a new inmate telephone system will be activated; notifying potential customers regarding the activation of the new inmate telephone system prior to installation and/or activation of the new inmate telephone system; and establishing a payment account for at least one customer prior to activation and/or installation of the new inmate telephone system. Notification may be through mail, signage, business cards, flyers, pre-recorded messages, and the like, and preferably occurs sufficiently in advance of installation and/or activation of the new inmate telephone system to permit customers to establish payment accounts such that calls may be placed to the customers almost immediately after activation of the new inmate telephone system. Accounts may be created and funds may be deposited over the Internet or over the phone (either through IVR or live CSRs).
