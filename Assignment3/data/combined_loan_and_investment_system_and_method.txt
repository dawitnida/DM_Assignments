Combined Loan and Investment System and Method . A combined loan and investment program comprises a computer processor and program code configured to be executed by the computer processor to process financial loan and investment data by calculating from the data interest and principal loan payments on a loan principal at a given rate and term, calculating investment performance data on a periodic principal investment deposit at a given rate and calculating loan principal amortization parameters as a function of the investment performance data. The present invention provides a method for paying off a mortgage and simultaneously generating wealth via an investment account by making a payment to a mortgagee, dividing the payment, applying a first portion of the payment to satisfy the interest due on the mortgage, applying a second portion of the payment to an investment account, allowing the investment account to grow and applying a portion of the investment account to satisfy the mortgage.
