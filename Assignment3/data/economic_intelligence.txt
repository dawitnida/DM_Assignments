ECONOMIC INTELLIGENCE . Aspects of the invention provide for the use of transactional data in the calculation of sub-scores that may be used in an index score. The sub-scores may include an account sub-score, an investment sub-score, and/or a discretionary sub-score. One or more sub-scores that represent an individual, an entity, or an economic sector may be used to create an index. Further aspects relate to calculating novel indices that more accurately represent and/or predict economic conditions.
