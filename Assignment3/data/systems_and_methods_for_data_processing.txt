Systems and methods for data processing . Methods and systems are disclosed for managing bundle pricing of services. In one implementation, a system comprises a database for storing master contracts and billing customizing tables. The master contracts refer to the data of the billing customizing tables by means of result and condition attributes. This has the advantage that a modification of the billing customizing data, such as for the purpose of changing the bundle pricing scheme for the master contracts, does not require storage of the updated data in the database.
