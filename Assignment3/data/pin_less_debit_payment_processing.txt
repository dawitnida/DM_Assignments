PIN-less Debit Payment Processing . This document describes tools for providing PIN-less debit (PLD) processing for a client, such as a merchant. In some embodiments, the tools intercept a request from a client to process a payment transaction for a consumer. If PLD processing is available for the transaction, the tools provide an indication to the client that PLD processing is an available option for processing the payment transaction. If the tools receive an indication that the consumer has opted to process the payment as a PLD transaction, the tools negotiate with a payment processor for fulfillment of the payment transaction. The tools are configured to handle one or more of the certification and compliance procedures required to process PLD transactions with a payment processor, thus allowing the client to process PLD transactions without having a direct payment processing relationship with a payment processor that offers PLD transaction processing.
