SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RISK ACCEPTANCE IN THE PROVISIONING OF PRICE PROTECTION PRODUCTS . A provider of price protection products may enter into an agreement with a set of terms and associated financial risk with a financial institution such that the financial institution provides indemnification against the financial risk associated with selling a commodity. The provider may analyze data, the terms of the agreement and perform scenario analyses to determine its financial risk and may lay off or take on more risk. The provider may offer price protection products to consumers via computing devices and retail locations. The products may have the same terms as the agreement between the provider and the financial institution, or may have different terms and conditions to either take on or lay off risk.
