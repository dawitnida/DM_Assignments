Method for providing securities rewards to customers . A method for providing securities rewards to customers. To perform the method, a merchant registers a certain amount of stock for a reward program. Qualifying customers identify themselves when they make purchases from the merchant. The customers are given dollar value rewards for their purchases. A reward broker keeps track of the dollar value rewards during a reward period, and purchases an amount of the merchant's stock representing the total amount of dollar value rewards during the reward period. The reward broker then disaggregates the stock into individual customer accounts, based on the percentage of the dollar value rewards awarded to the corresponding individual customers.
