Construct separation for resource amount determination . A technique is provided for managing bundles of constructs that may individually fail. Each bundle has a repetitively updated resource amount for counterbalancing a transfer of a failure risk pertaining to the respective bundle. Construct data is stored and a value of the resource amount is calculated for an individual time instance based on the construct data. It is determined whether a construct of a first bundle has failed. If not, a value of a resource amount for the first bundle is calculated, but if a construct has failed, a second bundle is generated that includes all constructs of the first bundle except for the construct having failed, and a value of a resource amount for the second bundle is calculated. The technique is particularly suitable for managing futures contracts that are based on a basket of credit default swaps as underlyings.
