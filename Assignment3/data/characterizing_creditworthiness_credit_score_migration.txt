Characterizing Creditworthiness Credit Score Migration . Data comprising a request to generate a migration score is received (for example, by a first computer system). The migration score characterizes a likelihood of a change in a level of creditworthiness of a consumer subsequent to generation of a current credit score. Thereafter, future credit score migration for the individual is estimated (for example, by the first computer system) using a predictive model trained using historical creditworthiness data derived from a plurality of individuals. The historical creditworthiness data includes, for each individual, a historical credit score and empirical performance data subsequent to a scoring date for the historical credit score. Thereafter, the estimated future credit score migration is associated (for example, by the first computer system) with a migration score. Provision of the migration score can then be initiated. Related apparatus, systems, techniques and articles are also described.
