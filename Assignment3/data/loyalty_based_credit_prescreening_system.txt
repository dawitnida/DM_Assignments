Loyalty-Based Credit Prescreening System . An integrated credit and loyalty offering to a retailer maximizes the effectiveness of both programs. The integrated system allows a retailer to enroll customers in a loyalty program, then solicit only pre-qualified customers immediately upon receipt of demographic information corresponding to the customer. The integrated system accepts transaction data from the retailer's loyalty program through the retailer's POS system to the credit prescreening program and awards appropriate loyalty rewards, as well as authorizing the retailer to offer credit to the pre-qualified customers. The credit prescreening process is done in real time as part of a retail transaction with the customer.
