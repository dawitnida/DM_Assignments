Methods and systems for identifying and tracking potential property rights in software products . Methods and systems for identifying and tracking potential property rights in a software product and useful in auditing the software product are disclosed. Files of the software product are scanned to determine potential property rights, preferably by scanning the source code of the files to identify certain textual strings and/or by scanning the file system information for the files. The files are fingerprinted, which can be used to retrieve previous audit records in the event of a match. New audit records are established for unmatched files, which are automatically populated with potential property rights information determined during the scan. Each audit record is opened in a record viewing/auditing application to allow diligence information to be reviewed and/or entered for each of the files. Licensing records are also preferably established, which summarize relevant licensing obligations, and which are linked with the audit records of affected files. From the audit records and/or the license records, various reports can be generated to allow the user to review relevant property rights diligence information and/or to take appropriate action in response.
