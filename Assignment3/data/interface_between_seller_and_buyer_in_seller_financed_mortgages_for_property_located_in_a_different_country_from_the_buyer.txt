Interface between seller and buyer in seller-financed mortgages for property located in a different country from the buyer . A method of providing a useful and novel interface between a buyer and a seller of a property that is seller-financed with at least one of these entities being located in a geographically different location from the property. Through this interface the seller is guaranteed prompt payments and the buyer can be provided all the provisions needed for a financial benefit, such as tax deductions on the mortgage interest (paid on an offshore immovable property) and would be assisted in all regulations, tax or otherwise, in the country of the purchased property.
