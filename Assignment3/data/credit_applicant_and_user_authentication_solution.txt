CREDIT APPLICANT AND USER AUTHENTICATION SOLUTION . The present invention provides a credit applicant and user authentication solution for authenticating the identity of a credit applicant or a credit user. In particular, a user of the authentication system establishes a user account and obtains authentication information. The user then provides the authentication information during a subsequent credit application or credit transaction to authenticate the user's identity. Authentication information may be renewed after each application or transaction at specified time intervals, based on monetary thresholds, specific geographic limitations, or any other methodology specified by the user.
