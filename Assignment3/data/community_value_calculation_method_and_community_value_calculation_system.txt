Community value calculation method and community value calculation system . With respect to social capital, since no market exists to deal with the social capital itself, financial evaluation based on cash flow cannot be performed. Profiles are created according to service attributes of services in a community. Then, members in a regional society are requested to selects one of the profiles and a questionnaire survey is conducted concerning actual situations of services in a community. Social capital indices are computed based on data collected in the survey, willingness to pay (WTP) is estimated for each service of the community in the regional society based on the social capital indices and the questionnaire data. Thereafter, to calculate a community value, one of the service attributes is designated and a difference among calculated marginal WTP values of some regional societies is evaluated as a financial value of social capital.
