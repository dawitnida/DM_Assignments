SYSTEMS, METHODS, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCTS FOR MONITORING COLLATERALIZATION OF PUBLIC-DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS . The present invention provides systems, methods, and computer program products for monitoring collateral positions of public-deposit accounts so as to efficiently pledge collateral to under-collateralized positions and release collateral from over-collateralized positions. For example, when a customer deposits additional funds, which results in an uninsured balance that exceeds the allocated collateral, the present invention may identify that account as being under-collateralized, determine the pledge amount required to properly collateralize the account, and then create, submit and track a pledge request that corresponds to the required pledge amount. Likewise, when a customer withdraws funds from a public-deposit account, which results in an uninsured balance that is less than the allocated collateral, the present invention may identify that account as being over-collateralized, determine the appropriate release amount, and then create, submit and track a release request that corresponds to the determined release amount.
