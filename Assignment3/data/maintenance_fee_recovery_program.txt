Maintenance fee recovery program . "As a licensed Real Estate Broker, a former Real Estate Regulator in Arizona and a licensed Community Association Manager in Florida, the procedures are outlined in the ""Text"" for the Maintenance Recovery Program. It has been formulated over the last eighteen years ro protect both buyers and sellers of the time share interval, which, at the last estimate is approximately three point six (3.6) million in the USA and approximately four point five (4.5) in the world and growing. The average price is $ 15,000 to over $ 25,000 per interval (week). The average yearly maintenance fee is approximately $ 400.00 per interval week owned per year. If a purchaser of a time share interval could recoup their maintenance fees and the Home Owners Association would be able to eliminate costly foreclosure proceedings it would then benefit all parties concerned."
