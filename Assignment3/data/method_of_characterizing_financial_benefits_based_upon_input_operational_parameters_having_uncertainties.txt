Method of characterizing financial benefits based upon input operational parameters having uncertainties . An improved method of characterizing the potential financial benefit to a facility such as a nuclear power plant that would result from various groups of possible activities includes determining a number of goals for the facility, identifying groups of activities that could effect achievement of the goal and, for each group of activities, determining a probability distribution on net present savings corresponding with implementation of the group of activities. The method includes identifying a number of operational parameters having an uncertainty and allowing the uncertainty to propagate through the method to provide the probability distribution on net present savings. A plurality of Monte Carlo trials are performed on the operational parameters to result in the probability distribution on net present savings that corresponds with implementation of the group of activities compared with a baseline group of activities.
