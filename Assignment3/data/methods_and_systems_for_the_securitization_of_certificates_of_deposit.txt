METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR THE SECURITIZATION OF CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT . Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and systems for securitization of certificates of deposit. In addition, the present invention relates to a corresponding security itself (e.g., a security associated with one or more certificates of deposit). As such, in one embodiment, the present invention creates a more or less standard investment instrument (i.e. the funding certificate) by pooling the CDs to back the instument--thus, the net effect is the replacement of non-marketable instrument provided by financial institutions (i.e. the CD) with negotiable securities issued in the public capital markets (i.e. the funding certificate)
