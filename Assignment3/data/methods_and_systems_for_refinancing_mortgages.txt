Methods and systems for refinancing mortgages . A method and system facilitate management of a payment of a home mortgage loan issued by one of a financial lender and a broker using a computer coupled to a database. The method comprises storing key mortgage loan information associated with a borrower, including data identifying the borrower, an amount of the mortgage loan, a rate of interest payable on the mortgage loan, and the term of the mortgage loan, and inputting market-available refinance data to the computer, wherein the market-available refinance data includes at least one of an interest rate and a loan program. The method also includes automatically comparing the market--available refinance data to the key mortgage loan information associated with the borrower to determine whether the market-available refinance data includes either a reduced finance rate or a shorter term than the borrower's current loan information, and if so, automatically executing a refinance rate lock for the borrower.
