HOME APPRECIATION PARTICIPATION NOTES . A method, computer program product and computer system for issuing and servicing a Home Appreciation Participation Note (HAPN) for a real estate property, which includes issuing an Participation Contract (PC) for the property to PC investors, where the PC has a value derived from a sharing formula based on a change of a proxy for the value of the property relative to an initial value of the proxy, and the proxy is independent of an actual current condition of the property (after the initial valuation); and issuing a HAPN Bond for the property to HAPN Bond investors, where the HAPN Bond has an initial value set as a sum of an amount paid for the PC and an amount paid for the HAPN Bond. Both the PC and the HAPN Bond represent claims on the property, and the HAPN Bond is a performance bond for the PC if the value of the PC is negative.
