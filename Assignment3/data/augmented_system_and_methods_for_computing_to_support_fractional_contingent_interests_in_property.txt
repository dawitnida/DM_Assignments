Augmented system and methods for computing to support fractional contingent interests in property . A computer system, and methods for making and using it, for changing digital electrical signals to generate a valuation of a fractional interest in a contingent interest in property, the computer apparatus including: an input device operable for converting input data representing property into input digital electrical signals representing the input date; a digital electrical computer having a processor, the processor electrically connected to the input device to receive the input digital electrical signals, the processor programmed to change3 the input digital electrical signals to produce modified digital electrical signals representing a valuation of a fractional interest in a contingent interest in the property associated with at least one lease default condition for the property; a memory electrically connected to the processor; and wherein the processor manipulates further digital electrical signals to generate at least one document for the contingent interest by inserting the valuation in pre-existing text data obtained from the memory; and an output device electrically connected to the processor to print the document.
