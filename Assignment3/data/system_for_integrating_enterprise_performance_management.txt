System for integrating enterprise performance management . An automated system (100) for integrating narrowly focused management systems in to a financial measurement and optimization system for a multi-enterprise commercial organization. A matrix of market value is developed for each enterprise in the organization. The matrices of market value are then used to guide the integration of narrow systems in to the organization's financial system. Value and risk are analyzed by element of value on the system date as required to complete and display the matrix of market value for the organization by enterprise. A series of scenarios under both normal and extreme conditions are then developed. The information from these scenarios is then combined with market value matrix information to determine the optimal mode for financial management. The information on the optimal mode of organization operation is then communicated to the integrated narrow systems for implementation. The efficient frontier for organization financial performance is also calculated, displayed and optionally printed.
