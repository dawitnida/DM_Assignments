Method of Doing the Business of Machine Vending . "Methods of machine vending with a third party are disclosed. The third party issues an authorization code that prevents a computerized vending machine (""CVM"") from being shut down automatically, or a de-authorization code that causes the CVM to be at least partially shut down. Use of such codes makes it more prudent for parties to enter into contracts that were previously impractical or susceptible of abuse by dishonest vending machine operators."
