Method and apparatus for generating page-level security in a computer generated report . "Methods and computer program products are disclosed for generating and viewing an electronic report having security features that allow for ""virtual bursting"" of the report for multiple users. A single report having multiple pages is generated such that each or some of the pages have security tags that are compared to a security identifier list of a particular user that acts as a security clearance for that user. Through this comparison, a subset of pages from the report is formed which makes up a ""report"" from the user's point of view that contains only data the user is allowed to see. This allows multiple users to view only authorized portions of a single report having page-level security determined by level breaks in the data."
