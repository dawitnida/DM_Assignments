Management systems and methods for maximizing return on assets . Systems and methods increase an entity's return on assets by allowing the entity to redeploy idle and surplus assets, assist in the sale and disposal process, and provide the resources to easily locate and buy from an aggregation of idle and surplus assets. The entity may establish confidential and secure internal trading communities, private trading communities and public trading groups. Pre-authorized users may view and search idle and surplus assets listed within the trading groups by category, keyword or attribute. Furthermore, the systems and methods may be integrated into the legacy systems and existing data structures of an entity.
