Check verification, check cashing and check settlement interface . A method, a framework, and a computer program product for an interface for providing check verification, cashing and electronic settlement services are provided. The method receives information including check information for a check being negotiated for monies. The check information is verified by comparing the received check information with issued check information stored at the check issuing financial institution. Upon verifying the received check information, a status flag associated with the check information is modified to indicate that the received check information has been verified and the system marks a void or presentment notification with the check. The verified check information representing an issued check is then authorized for cash settlement. Upon exchanging the check for monies, information is transmitted to the financial institution notifying the financial institution that the check has been negotiated and the issuing financial institution submits a settlement file in the amount of the settled amount to a designated account.
