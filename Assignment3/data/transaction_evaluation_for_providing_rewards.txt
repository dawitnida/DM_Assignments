TRANSACTION EVALUATION FOR PROVIDING REWARDS . An amount of loyalty program currency is pre-selected by a consumer and exchanged for a corresponding value-added reward also pre-selected by the consumer. The pre-selected reward, which can be a value added back to the consumer payment device, is given when the consumer conducts their pre-selected transaction using their consumer payment device. The amount of the loyalty program currency can be added back to the consumer payment device, and later exchanged for the consumer pre-selected value-adding rewards, by the consumer's transactional use of their consumer payment device. Consumer pre-selected value-added rewards, for instance, can appear as statement credits to an account associated with the consumer payment device. As such, an incentive exists for the consumer to pre-select a transaction to conduct with their consumer payment device to realize a corresponding pre-selected statement credit for such loyal use of their consumer payment device.
