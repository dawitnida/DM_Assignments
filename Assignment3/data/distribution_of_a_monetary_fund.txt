Distribution of a monetary fund . A method of allocating units in a monetary fund includes the steps of: determining an initial unit allocation for each policyholder of the fund, and periodically allocating extra units to surviving policyholders of the fund. The number of extra units being allocated is based on a probability of availability of units in the fund arising from deceased policyholders.
