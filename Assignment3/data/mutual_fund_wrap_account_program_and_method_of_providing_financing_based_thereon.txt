Mutual fund wrap account program and method of providing financing based thereon . A method of providing financing based on a wrap program, wherein the wrap program includes an investor paying a contingent fee option, the contingent fee option including a contingent fee component and an on-going fee component. In certain embodiments, the investor has the option of paying an upfront fee option instead of the contingent fee option. The contingent fee component includes a contingent payment over time, for example, in each of one or more years, payable by the investor upon redemption of at least a portion of its investment or termination of the investor's account. A financing company purchases any one or more of the future payments under the contingent fee option for an upfront payment, thereby providing the wrap account provider with a means of financing. Preferably, the contingent fee option is paid by the investor in return for pre-sales services, and a separate fee, if any, is charged to the investor in return for post-sales services.
