VALUATION OF CONTINGENT FINANCIAL CLAIMS USING DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES . Systems, methods, and computer-readable media are provided relating to computing financial values for contingent claims. A declarative programming language is provided that comprises several primitives. A program according to such a language may combine primitives to create a description of a contingent claim or type of contingent claims. Such a program may be compiled into an executable form and, when executed, may calculate a financial value for a claim. Calculation of the financial value may make use of mathematical models, techniques, or both, including statistical and Monte Carlo methods. A program may declare one or more parameters to be supplied at execution time, and the computed value may depend on the supplied values of some or all of the parameters.
