FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS FOR THE HOUSING MARKET . A first financial instrument defines an interest in a property, where one or more buyers are given rights on at least part of a selling price of the property. The interest is purchasable by the interest buyers independently of time of sale of the property and independently of change of occupants of the property. A second financial instrument separates habitational rights in a habitable property from non-habitational rights in that property. A combination between the two financial instruments is also provided.
