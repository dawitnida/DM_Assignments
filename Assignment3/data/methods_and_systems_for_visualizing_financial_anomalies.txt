Methods and systems for visualizing financial anomalies . A visualization technique for directing the attention of analysts to anomalous values of performance measures associated with a target entity is described. A grid of cells is created where each row represents a particular performance metric, and each column a particular time period. For each cell, an anomaly score is calculated associated with the performance metric and time period corresponding to the row and column of the cell. The anomaly score is based on the value of the performance metric for that particular entity for that time period, as well as context data. The context data is selected to represent the historical values of the performance metric for the target entity or the simultaneous performance of peer entities. The anomaly score is calculated using an exceptional statistical technique, and a display characteristic is associated with the value of the anomaly score based upon the range into which the anomaly score falls. The display characteristic is displayed within the cell on the grid, forming an anomaly map that allows identification of patterns among the performance metrics.
