Network based loan approval and document origination system . A customer sends loan information through the Internet to a loan approval system mainframe of a bank. The information is entered into a blank load form displayed on a web site hosted by the loan approval system computer. The loan approval system mainframe produces a loan application and sends the loan application to a credit bureau. The credit bureau determines whether the customer should receive the loan. If the customer is to receive the loan, the loan approval system computer sends the loan application to a loan document creation server coupled to a forms database. The loan document creation server sends the appropriate loan documents and/or check to the customer either physically or electronically. In one embodiment, acceptance of the terms of the loan in the loan documents occurs when the customer cashes the check.
