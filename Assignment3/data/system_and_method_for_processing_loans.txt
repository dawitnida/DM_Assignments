System and Method for Processing Loans . Loan requests may be automatically processed for approval and fulfillment by a distributed processing system. The processing system receives loan requests and determines whether the loan should be approved and, if needed, request supplemental loan information from vendor systems. The processing system may further perform due diligence, generate closing documents and board loans. Exceptions may be detected and handled manually if necessary; once work on exceptions are complete, the remainder of loan processing may be completed automatically. In some configurations, a loan request or tasks thereof may be transferred from a processing system at a first processing center to a second processing center to continue processing in response to a predefined event. The first and second processing centers may be located in different time zones. Additionally, the processing system may provide a simulation environment for evaluating process models prior to implementation in a live processing environment.
