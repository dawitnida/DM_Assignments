RECEIPTS SCANNER AND FINANCIAL ORGANIZER . "The system contains a scanner, an apparatus for scanning receipts into a computer and a unique software program which automatically processes, organizes and saves expense information that can be viewed in various formats, namely, tabular statements, pie-charts, etc. The scanner, which accommodates paper of differing sizes, is used to input bills, receipts, bank statements, etc. The scanner is usually connected to a computer through a Universal Serial Bus or a parallel port for easy installation. The software program creates a text file of the scanned data by inclusion of sorting, categories, etc., and automatically saves the information in Quicken Interchange Format, allowing it to be imported into any financial management software for further processing. Each receipt is treated as an individual transaction. Multiple items in the receipt are used to create a ""split"" transaction with proper customizable categories added. Further, the software also allows for record keeping, budgeting and budget balancing."
