SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ANALYZING A CONTRACT . Embodiments of the invention can provide systems and methods for analyzing a contract. According to one embodiment, a computer-implemented method for estimating a contract's profitability and risk exposure using various contract terms, potential cash flows, and pricing strategies can be provided. By estimating the contract's profitability and risk exposure across a variety of conditions, a valuation-risk profile is determined and can be presented to a user. The valuation-risk profile provides an objective value of any particular contract component and a quantitative framework for negotiation purposes. In addition, the valuation-risk profile can be used as part of a larger strategic plan, for risk assessment, and for general decision-making.
