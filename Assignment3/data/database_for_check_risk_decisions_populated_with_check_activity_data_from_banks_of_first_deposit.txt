DATABASE FOR CHECK RISK DECISIONS POPULATED WITH CHECK ACTIVITY DATA FROM BANKS OF FIRST DEPOSIT . A plurality of banks of first deposit provide checking account activity data for both transit items (checks received for deposit that need to be cleared) and incoming returns (bounced checks) to a statistical model which determines from the data the likelihood that a check from a specific checking account will be returned. This data is used to populate a database of checking accounts to be used for making check risk decisions, such as check hold policy decisions, check acceptance decisions, and open to buy decisions.
