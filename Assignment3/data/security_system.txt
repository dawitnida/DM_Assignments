SECURITY SYSTEM . A credit card scanning protection system configured to send an electronic message to the cardholder's mobile phone (or other electronic device) when the cardholder's card is used in a transaction. In the event the cardholder receives notice of an unauthorized transaction, the cardholder can immediately call the issuing authority and query the transaction or have the card suspended. The system provides the card issuing authority with the ability to select and set rules relating to electronic message alerts. Examples include alerts for all cash withdrawals, transactions over a specified amount and transactions with a new merchant or in a new geographic area. The system also allows for customer interactivity whereby the cardholder can specify events which would govern the transmission of an electronic alert.
