SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETERMINING A FINANCIAL HEALTH INDICATOR . Systems, methods, and computer program products are provided for a financial health indicator. The financial health indicator provides a dynamic indication of a user's financial health in terms of their current credit worthiness and their current ability to save in relation to a budget. In this regard, the financial health indicator is based on a user's credit report score, such as one or more FICO type credit scores and the user's savings as indicated by a budget tracking system. In embodiments of the invention in which the financial health indicator is implemented in conjunction with a budget tracking system, the financial health indicator provides necessary feedback to the user that serves to inform the user as to how they are performing in terms of staying on track to their individual budget allocations. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the provider of the budget tracking system may provide for awards based on achieving a predefined financial health indicator level and/or score.
