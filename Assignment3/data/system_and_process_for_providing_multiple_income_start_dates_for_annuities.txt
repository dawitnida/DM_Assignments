System and process for providing multiple income start dates for annuities . The present invention provides a method for providing an annuity structure and a system for processing an annuity structure. The annuity structure may include a base portion segment, where the base portion segment is a functional annuity having a first annuity schedule; and a secondary portion segment, where the secondary portion segment is a functional annuity having a second annuity schedule. In the invention, the base portion segment and the secondary portion segment each operate as its own annuity. Also, the base portion segment and the secondary portion segment are each included in a single contract, i.e., under the umbrella of one contract.
