Method for facilitating real estate investments and investment management thereof . A method for facilitating real estate investments for formulating, managing and facilitating an investment strategy for a variety of property types and geographic markets. The method provides a real estate investment model having a cash flow while providing a back end equity build. Further, the method permits control of equity growth of several hundreds of thousands of dollars in single family residential real estate with only a few tens of thousands of cash out-of-pocket, and very little sweat equity. The method provides a tool for real estate investment that can be implemented and managed largely from an investor's/user's desk. The investment method provided gives the investor the benefit of new home warranties, so that repairs are largely taken care of by someone else. The method offers an impressive upside potential secured by real estate, paid for with a tenant/purchaser's money.
