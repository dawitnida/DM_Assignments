System and method for providing customers with seamless entry to a remote server . The present invention provides a seamless entry system that comprises a universal session manager. Users connect to the host service provider with a unique username and password. Then, through a series of data exchanges between the universal session manager, a validation database, and the remote service module, the customer may be transparently logged into remote service providers. Internet banking customers utilize a browser system to connect to a host server providing a range of banking services supported by a remote or distinct server. According to the method, the customer first enters a username and password to gain access to the host service provider. The universal session manager transmits data required for login to the remote service provider. The user is thus able to utilize the remote services with his/her web browser system without having entered a username or password particular to the remote service.
