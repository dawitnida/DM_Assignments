Systems and methods for evaluating terms of a deal to purchase a vehicle . Systems and methods provide advice to a customer that is purchasing a vehicle. For example, a customer may use a hand-held device while at a dealership, or use a computer, to enter terms of a deal, such as financing information. The customer may use the device to send the information electronically to a remote system associated with a financing company. The system evaluates the deal and returns information to the customer via the device indicating whether the deal is fair. Furthermore, the system may also transmit to the customer a report indicating how to improve the deal for the customer.
