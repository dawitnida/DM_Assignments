Central counterparty for data management . "A central counterparty for data management (CCDM) receives data relating to financial transactions, associates the data with metadata to create reference data, stores the reference data and provides the reference data in ""push"" and ""pull"" ways. The ""push"" techniques for providing the data include distributing on a data feed, sending the data to parties known to be relevant to the transaction, and sending the data to parties who have a standing query that is satisfied by the data. The ""pull"" techniques for providing the data include responding to queries received from a variety of parties. The CCDM generates and distributes unique, unambiguous and universal identifiers (U3id's) and associates the U3id identifiers with the reference data."
