Automated understanding and decomposition of table-structured electronic documents . Systems and methods for automatically understanding and decomposing unstructured tabular information are described. No constraints are placed on the origin or format of these documents when originally submitted; the documents may be in an unstructured and/or nonstandard format, and they may be electronic or flat files. The systems and methods of this invention generally comprise obtaining an electronic ASCII-formatted document, analyzing and understanding the contents of the document, and decomposing the information contained in the document, utilizing a variety of algorithms and heuristics to do this. Embodiments of this invention automatically process a multitude of financial documents, thereby eliminating the need for human interaction with such documents in many cases and lowering the costs associated with processing such documents.
