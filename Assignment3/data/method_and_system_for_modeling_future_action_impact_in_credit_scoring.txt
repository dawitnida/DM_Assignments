METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MODELING FUTURE ACTION IMPACT IN CREDIT SCORING . A method and system for predicting impact of future actions on subsequent performance involves developing a prediction model that predicts a statistical interaction of performance expectation with likely behavior. In one embodiment, sensitivity to new, post-scoring date credit behaviors in the analytic solution greatly improves snapshot score predictions. The modeling approach involves multiple snapshots: predictive and performance snapshots, plus an intermediate snapshot shortly after the predictive snapshot to quantify interim behavior. Predictive interaction variables are calculated on the predictive data using simulated profiles before and after an action.
