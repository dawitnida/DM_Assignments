Real-time credit rating using a single financial account . Provided is a real-time method for calculating a credit report based upon information associated with a single, integrated financial account. The account has an associated balance based upon deposits and withdrawals, regardless of the type of transaction that generated a particular deposit or withdrawal. An account history is maintained and employed to calculate a credit rating. The rating is determined by an inspection of the integrated account. Information associated with the account is transferable. As deposits and withdrawals are made to an account, the credit rating can be adjusted in real-time. Metric information such as the frequency of deposits and withdrawals can be used as a factor in the calculation of a credit rating. Payment made by another customer on a co-signed loan, can also be a factor. Collateral deemed appropriate may be placed in the account and the customer's credit rating adjusted to reflect the value of the collateral.
