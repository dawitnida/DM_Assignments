System and method for determining the financial impact of an event . The present invention provides a computer-based system, method and computer program product for inventorying assets and quickly determining the financial costs of an event impacting the location where such assets are located. A user is able to enter impact location identifiers and one or more asset impact variables using a user interface. A storage device stores an impact location profile for each of one or more impact location identifiers. An asset impact management module then retrieves an impact location profile corresponding to the impact location identifiers. The asset impact management module also retrieves at least one segment area analysis identifier. Each segment area identifier is associated with one or more segment area impact variables. A financial impact analyzer determines the financial costs of an event using the impact location profile, the segment area impact variables and the asset impact variables. Once the financial costs are determined, a financial impact analysis report is prepared for presentation on a display.
