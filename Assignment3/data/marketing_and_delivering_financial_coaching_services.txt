MARKETING AND DELIVERING FINANCIAL COACHING SERVICES . Marketing and delivering financial coaching services involves sponsoring a website pertaining to financial coaching services, engaging an electronic communications media partner to direct potential customers to the website, and calculating a behavior-based quality rating reflecting the business opportunity value of the potential customer. The potential customer is advanced within the website to a supplemental landing page, a chat window, a bump offer screen, or a customer consultation page based on data from the potential customer. When the quality rating exceeds a predetermined threshold quality rating, the potential customer is associated to an assigned sales agent. In a telephone conference initiated by the assigned sales agent, an interest rating is determined for the potential customer reflecting the importance of the financial coaching services to the potential customer. When the interest rating exceeds a predetermined threshold interest rating, the potential customer is associated to an assigned enroller. In a telephone conference initiated by the assigned enroller a readiness rating is determined for the potential customer reflecting the willingness of the potential customer to purchase financial coaching services. When the readiness rating for the potential customer exceeds a predetermined readiness rating, the potential customer is enrolled as a buyer of financial coaching services and oriented by telephone. Using electronic communication media, the buyer is conducted through an ordered sequence of one-on-one financial coaching sessions and supplied with financial coaching resources. The buyer completes assignments between consecutive pairs of financial coaching sessions.
