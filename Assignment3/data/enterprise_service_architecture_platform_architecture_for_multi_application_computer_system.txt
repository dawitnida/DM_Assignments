Enterprise service architecture platform architecture for multi-application computer system . Centralized process context and information context are provided for a computer system having an enterprise service architecture platform. The process context is a centrally accessible object storing and providing status data generated during performance of a process flow. The process context permits firm personnel to review performance of the process flow, for example, to determine its status and to identify any business exceptions that may have occurred therein. The information context caches information generated during performance of the process flow. It provides data on which to assess firm performance parameters, for example, time elapsed during performance of each process step and it provides a detailed set of information describing the process business activity. The process context and information context support higher-level monitoring functions. The process context and information context relieve operators from directly addressing a host of process-specific applications during performance of process flows.
