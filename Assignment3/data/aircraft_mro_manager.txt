AIRCRAFT MRO MANAGER . Electronic aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) tools that improve an organizations ability to manage nearly every phase of an aircraft maintenance visit. MRO management may be implemented at the single aircraft level all the way up to the organization level including several facilities each of which include several aircrafts. The disclosed MRO management solutions assist with mapping out short term and long term planning; including manpower and material and tooling requirements. Additionally, current and future workloads may be identified and considered in advance of maintenance execution to significantly improve stakeholder satisfaction. The methods and systems disclosed generate an electronic contract based on a bill of work to control maintenance task execution, report progress of executing the tasks, and process scope changes to the bill of work and the associated contract. Improved communication of financial milestones and timely closure of both maintenance work and billing processes is facilitated by generating billing invoices and processing electronic approvals based on the electronic contract and the bill of work. Customer flexibility is improved by providing standalone management tools, as well as integration with existing external systems. Additional features include supply chain management and tooling controls necessitated by growing regulatory demands.
