Systems and methods for accessing and using phone number validation information . Systems and methods are described for accessing information indicative of the validity or non-validity of a telephone number offered in association with a transaction and for using the information to better evaluate the risk of participating in the transaction. In one embodiment, a telephone number validation system accesses stored information about numerical patterning, formatting, and/or correlations that may help to distinguish between valid and non-valid telephone numbers. In one embodiment, a telephone number validation system accesses stored information about telephone numbers that have been previously determined to be valid or non-valid. In other embodiments, a telephone number validation system accesses a third party telephone number validation service that determines whether a telephone number offered in conjunction with a proposed financial transaction is valid or non-valid and that provides results regarding the validation determination to the telephone number validation system for use in evaluating the risk of a proposed transaction.
