EXCHANGE TRADED ASSET BASED SECURITY . This invention provides a security and an index that may be based on any asset or derivative asset or a combination of these including but not limited to a commodity, a debt issuance, a currency, an equity or a basket or an index of any of these that has a forward (or term) price structure, a forward contract market, an expiration date and can be rolled forward. The security is designed to meet the specific needs of investors and offer unique risk/return characteristics. The exchange traded, structured investment security is based on an asset and is linked through its entitlement to the value or performance of the asset as measured by an index. The asset has a forward price structure, a forward market, an expiration date and is able to be rolled forward into another asset with a later expiry date. In this Invention the asset is rolled into another asset with a later expiry date having the same value as the asset. The value method of this invention differs from prior art where components of a composite index are assigned a fixed percentage of the value of the index at inception and periodic rebalanced to maintain the fixed value of each component in the index.
