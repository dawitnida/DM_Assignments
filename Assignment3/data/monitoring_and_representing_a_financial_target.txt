Monitoring and representing a financial target . A method is described for monitoring a financial target of a user using a self service terminal (SST), and for assisting the user in meeting the target. The method comprises obtaining details of a user's target (such as a particular desired purchase) together with a visual representation of that target whenever the user wishes to conduct a financial transaction with the SST. The financial status of the user, including a savings regime or budget, is obtained and compared with the target to determine a proximity to the target. When the user requests a financial transaction be performed, the proximity to the target after the transaction is performed is calculated and compared with the original proximity. The visual representation of the target is then modified to represent the change in proximity, and displayed to the user to show the effect of the requested transaction on the savings regime. The user is then requested to confirm or cancel the transaction.
