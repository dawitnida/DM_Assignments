Systems and methods for providing spending information and budgeting recommendations to students . Systems and methods are provided for electronically providing spending information and budgeting recommendations to a student of an educational institution. The systems and methods comprise capturing student interaction data, wherein the student interaction data has one or more data elements. At least one of the captured one or more data elements is associated with student financial account usage. The systems and methods provide spending data based on the student financial account usage, and provide one or more spending recommendations based at least in part on the associated student financial account usage. The spending recommendations may be based at least in part on a student role (e.g., first year student, second year student, a transfer student, a non-traditional student, or a foreign student, etc.), demographic, activities attended, or academic major.
