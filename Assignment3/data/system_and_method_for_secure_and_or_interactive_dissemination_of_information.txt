SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SECURE AND/OR INTERACTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION . An interactive information dissemination system includes a media server (210) for receiving a plurality of media elements and storing the media elements in a database. A sender client (200) enables a first user to identify message data, a recipient identifier, and a media element from the database of media elements. A recipient client (202) presents the media element to a second user associated with the recipient identifier. The recipient client (202) further presents the message data to the second user when the second user performs a predetermined action, such as submitting authentication information or requesting the message data, to receive the message data. The message data may be secured by requiring sender and recipient authentication, and by encoding the data using a private encoding key and data package identifier managed by a main server (206) and a key server (208).
