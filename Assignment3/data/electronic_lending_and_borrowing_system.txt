Electronic lending and borrowing system . A common forum for borrowing and lending includes a plurality of remote devices associated with respective potential counterparts, a communications network for permitting communication between the remote devices, and a central server computer. Each user enters preferences and data pertaining to what he or she would like to lend or borrow and under what conditions. The central server computer then uses the preferences of lending and borrowing data from each user to identify possible counterparts that might be mutually acceptable based on the preference information. Once a match occurs, the potential counterparts can negotiate through the central server to negotiate some or all terms. After the negotiation is complete, the forum will reveal the counterpart details to both the parties of contract for settlement.
