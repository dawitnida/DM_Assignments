System and method for controlling electronic exchange of access to a leisure asset . A system and method for the exchange of an asset, preferably a leisure asset is disclosed. The system allows a user and/or an artificial intelligence module to search an asset database containing information about a number of assets other users have listed for an acceptable asset to exchange. Once a potential exchange asset is identified, the user makes an offer. If the offer is accepted, a validity checker validates the parties' rights ownership, exchange and use rights. Because the validation of ownership and use rights occur only after an exchange offer has been accepted, and is performed as of the time of utilization (and not simply the time the information is entered into the database), the quality of the information contained in the proposed exchange is greatly enhanced and the likelihood of fraud is greatly reduced. At any time until the completion of a proposed exchange, the users may amend or remove the asset from the asset database.
