PAYMENT ACCOUNT PROCESSING WHICH CONVEYS FINANCIAL TRANSACTION DATA AND NON FINANCIAL TRANSACTION DATA . A payment processing system enables a consumer to purchase items at a merchant using an account provided by an issuer. Financial data related to payment for the purchase are sent by the merchant through an acquirer and a transaction expeditor to the issuer. The issuer responds by determining whether to authorize the purchase and if authorized, sends a notification back to the merchant. The acquirer also issues non-financial data that is conveyed by the transaction expeditor to a recipient connected to the payment processing system. The financial and non-financial data for the same transaction may be sent in separate messages and a technique is provided for matching those messages at the recipient. Different types of non-financial data can be conveyed, such as identification of the items being purchased which the recipient uses to determine whether the consumer should receive a reward under a product purchase incentive program.
