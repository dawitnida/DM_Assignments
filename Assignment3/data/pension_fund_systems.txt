Pension Fund Systems . There is provided a computer-implemented method of projecting the future cash flows of a pension scheme, comprising: receiving data representative of the members of the pension scheme; receiving data representative of a mortality assumption; calculating, using data processing apparatus, for each pension scheme member, a projection of the future cash flow liabilities of the pension scheme to that member on the basis of the pension scheme member data and by applying the mortality assumption data to the pension scheme member data; and generating, using data processing apparatus, data representative of a projected liability cash flow of the pension scheme to all of its members by aggregating the liabilities to each member.
