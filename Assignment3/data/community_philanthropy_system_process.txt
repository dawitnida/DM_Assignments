Community Philanthropy System & Process . A computer-implemented process and system for the distribution of resources such as funds to not-for-profit (NFP) entities or other organizations. The system may include a resource accumulation module for acquiring and keeping track of resources, a resource division module for initially determining what to do with resources that have been acquired, an education module for teaching users about the entities or their respective causes, an evaluation module for determining whether a user is eligible to vote on the distribution of resources, and a voting module through which users may choose the resource recipients. In one embodiment, resources may be obtained at least in part from the commissions generated by real estate transactions. In addition, users and/or voters may include students around the world, and organizations may include various NFPs, also located around the world.
