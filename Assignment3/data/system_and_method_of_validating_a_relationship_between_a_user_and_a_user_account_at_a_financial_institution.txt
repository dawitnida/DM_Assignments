System and Method of Validating a Relationship Between a User and a User Account at a Financial Institution . A system and method for validating a relationship between a user and a user account at a financial institution includes a data communication device, a memory, a processor coupled to the memory, and an account validation module executable by the processor. The account validation module generates a verification identifier for storage in the memory and is provided to the user, and subsequently receives a user initiated financial transaction involving the user account at the financial institution. The received financial transaction includes a comparison identifier supplied by the user. The account validation module determines whether the comparison identifier corresponds to the verification identifier for purposes of validating the relationship between the user and the user account maintained at the financial institution.
