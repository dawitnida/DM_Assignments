METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR IMPLEMENTING AN ENSEMBLE MERCHANT PREDICTION SYSTEM . A computer-based method for discovering patterns in financial transaction card transaction data for the purpose of determining group membership of a merchant within the transaction data is described. The data relates to merchants that accept the financial transaction card for payment. The method includes receiving transaction data from at least one database, predicting a membership of a merchant in a group using at least one prediction algorithm and the retrieved transaction data, the algorithm generating meta-data describing the predictions, inputting the at least one predicted group membership and the meta-data into a data mining application, and assigning a confidence value to each predicted group membership by the data mining application, utilizing the predicted group memberships and the meta-data.
