Certificate of deposit portfolio system and method . "A certificate of deposit (""CD"") portfolio system and method to attract institutional investors through dealers to CD issuing small to medium sized community deposit taking institutions. The central entities of the system include a system operator and a system clearing house. The system operator contacts and signs up the institutions to become a part of the system. These institutions are community banks that are too small to individually attract institutional investors. It also contacts and signs up dealers and then unitizes FDIC insured CD's into single investment instrument portfolios which the dealers then market to their institutional investor clientele. The clearing house is in communication with the system operator, the institutions and the dealers to act as an agent facilitating transactions by issuing the CD's, handling funds, settling transactions, and acting as custodian/trustee for all transactions. The invention includes a system operator controlled internet website to provide access to information to for the use of CD issuing banks, the system clearing house, the system operator and the dealers. In effect the invention creates a meeting place for small banks to pool their FDIC insured CD's together into single investment instrument portfolios large enough to attract institutional investors at favorable interest rates because of the credit enhancement resulting from full FDIC insurance of the portfolio. This is achieved because the system and method prevent exceeding the $100,000.00 FDIC insurance limit per investor per bank."
