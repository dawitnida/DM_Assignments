Real-time pin disbursement system . An automated system and method of purchasing prepaid and other services against a deposit or a credit threshold. A server provisions requests for electronic PINs. This provisioning server maintains a record for each retail merchant, distributor, or third party processor. Depending on their credit worthiness, the control server either establishes a credit threshold retail merchant, distributor or third party processor or requires a cash deposit. A retail merchant or distributor or a third party processor may obtain an electronic PIN from the provisioning server in real-time or in batches against their credit threshold or deposit.
