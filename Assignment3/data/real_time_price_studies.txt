Real-time price studies . An improved method and system for computerized trading of securities in which order preferences for securities are entered by a user and are stored on a computer system for future use as default values in response to the user placing an order. The time that it takes to complete an order may be reduced through the use of previously selected order preferences being displayed to the user in the order placement window. In another method for order entry, a user may specify a price-point and a security transaction flag option for a security transaction (e.g., buy, sell, sell short, stop loss, stop limit, sell to open, sell to close, buy to open, buy to close) on a price chart window for a particular security. The computer system monitors the price fluctuation of the particular security, and takes the specified security transaction in response to the specified price-point being reached. In another embodiment, real-time results for user-selected studies are utilized as a tool for a user to decide on a price-point at which to take a particular security transaction on a particular security.
