METHODS OF FINANCING CONSTRUCTION AND SALES OF REAL PROPERTY . Financial instruments incentivize the development of low income real property by retaining profitability similar to property sold at fair market value. A REEIP is proposed wherein investors profit by receiving units of real property at a substantial discount that may be subsequently sold or rented after title passes to the investor. A construction fees, costs, or tax instrument are built into each real property unit and issued as a second or subsequent mortgage for all fees and compliance costs, which allows the purchaser of the real property to purchase the real property at a discount by removing the fees and compliance costs from the purchase price of the real property. Finally, real property may be sold to qualifying low income purchasers by allowing a developer to gradually turn over equity in a low income home to the purchaser over a predetermined time period, which is secured by a forgivable mortgage.
