System and method for recording negotiable instruments . A system and method of putting holders of negotiable instruments on notice of a possible defect or defense and for recording descriptive information about that negotiable instrument in a location accessible to holders of the instrument. The system includes a database (11) into which descriptive information about a negotiable instrument can be registered or recorded. Such descriptive information includes details relating to a defect or defense against its payment. A maker or holder (12) records descriptive information about a negotiable instrument electronically or by direct access to the database (11) through a graphical user interface (14) over the Internet (15) storage facility by conveying (such as through the mails) details regarding the negotiable instrument to a storage facility where the information will be entered on the database by a customer service representative (18), or by telephoning (19,29) the storage facility and audibly conveying the descriptive information which is then electronically recorded in the database (11). The graphical user interface (14) contains fields into which the descriptive information may be entered. The instrument (30) created by the maker contains a notice (36), on the face of the instrument, of possible defects or defenses and a notation (37) how to access the database (11) to learn of the details of such possible defects or defenses.
