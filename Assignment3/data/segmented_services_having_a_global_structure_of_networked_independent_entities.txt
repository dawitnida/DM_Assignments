Segmented services having a global structure of networked independent entities . A method, apparatus and system of segmented services having a global structure of networked independent entities are disclosed. In one embodiment, a method of a network of patent attorneys includes providing a holistic patent services support solution to a patent attorney forming a separate entity, permitting the separate entity to adopt a trade identity different than that of the network of patent attorneys, and performing a core portion of a patent legal service through the separate entity of the patent attorney. The method may include transferring a relationship between the patent attorney and a client to the network of the patent attorneys, and marketing a corporate ownership interest of the network of patent attorneys to parties other than members of a State Bar Association to which the patent attorney belongs without violating a regulation of the State Bar Association when the core portion is performed through the separate entity.
