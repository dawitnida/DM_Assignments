Method and system for financial counseling . Financial institutions providing counseling to costumers have to spend a significant amount of time gathering data from their clients and analyzing that data before offering appropriate financial advice to their customers. Some Debt Management Programs allow costumers to enroll using online systems without appropriate education or counseling. The present invention allows a costumer to obtain financial counseling automatically. A Credit Report Data Integration system, furthermore, streamlines the process by allowing the system to obtain data, with consent of the customer, from the credit bureaus to determine the financial needs of the client. The system allows the counselor to concentrate on counseling the client, instead of dealing with data entry and analysis. Furthermore, the client has the opportunity, if desired, to receive counseling from the system without having to actually meet a counselor.
