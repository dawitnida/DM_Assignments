Report Generator for Allowing Financial Entity to Monitor Securities Class Action Lawsuits and Potential Monetary Claims Resulting Therefrom . Reports are automatically created that allow a financial entity to review and track potential monetary claims resulting from securities class action lawsuits for securities purchased or acquired by the financial entity. To create the reports, a first database of transaction activity for the financial entity is accessed. The transaction activity includes an identification of each security purchased or acquired, and the date of each purchase or acquisition. A second database of securities class action lawsuits is accessed. The second database includes for each lawsuit an identification of all securities associated with the class action lawsuit, and the class period of the lawsuit. The transaction activity of the financial entity is automatically compared with the securities class action lawsuits in the second database, and any securities purchased or acquired by the financial entity during the class period that are associated with an entered securities class action lawsuit are identified. The identified securities may provide a potential monetary claim for the financial entity. A report is then automatically created of at least the lawsuits that may provide a potential monetary claim for the financial entity based on the transaction activity of the financial entity. The report also includes estimated market loss and eligible loss information, as well as any actions recommended to be taken by the financial entity regarding the lawsuits.
