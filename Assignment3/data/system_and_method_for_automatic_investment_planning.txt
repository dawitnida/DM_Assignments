System and Method for Automatic Investment Planning . A computerized scheme automates investment planning for a client. In the scheme, data regarding the client's desired asset allocation, current asset portfolio and preferred domain are input into a computer or processor. This data are used to automatically generate financial transaction recommendations for modifying the client's current asset portfolio to reach as close as possible to the desired asset allocation and the preferred domain. The recommendations include specific recommendations for selling amounts of selected current assets and specific recommendations for buying amounts of one or more investment funds. The recommendations are displayed on a summary report for review by the client or the client's financial manager, or the recommendations are electronically communicated to a trade execution computer which automatically performs the necessary transactions to execute the buy/sell recommendations. The recommendations are selected in a manner which minimizes the tax impacts and transaction costs of potential sell transactions.
