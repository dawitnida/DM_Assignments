Financing method for distressed real property . A method for providing financing to owners of distressed property in a stage of preforeclosure. The owner is first identified and then executes a note for an amount sufficient to remove the real property from the preforeclosure stage. That note sets forth repayment terms for a preset period of time and at an interest rate which may be either fixed or variable. After execution of the note, the face value of the note is remitted directly to the lending institution thereby removing the real property from the preforeclosure stage. Optionally, a plurality of notes are bundled together in a financial package and that financial package is then sold to a financial institution.
