Detecting modifications to financial terminals . A method of detecting unauthorized modifications of financial terminals includes receiving an electromagnetic profile from the terminal, comparing the received profile to a stored profile, and determining whether unauthorized modifications have been made based on the comparison. The determination may be based on a correlation coefficient and the method may include transmitting a stimulus profile in an active mode. A system for detecting unauthorized modifications to financial terminals includes a receiver to receive the emitted profile and a computing device. The computing device compares the received profile to the stored profile to determine whether unauthorized modifications have been made. The system may also include a transmitter to transmit a stimulus profile in an active mode, wherein the received profile is emitted by the financial terminal in response to the stimulus profile. The system may also be incorporated in the financial terminal.
