TAXONOMY EXTENSION GENERATION AND MANAGEMENT . Systems and methods of establishing a standardized financial data model may include financial document management system. The financial document management system may receive a credential from a user and may authenticate the user based on the credential to permit access to the system. The financial document management system may further receive a financial taxonomy extension corresponding to a financial reporting item from the first user and a financial taxonomy decision regarding the received financial taxonomy extension from a taxonomy standardization system. After receiving the decision, the financial document management system may determine whether the financial taxonomy extension may be approved and/or rejected based on the received financial taxonomy decision. If approved, the financial document management system may add the received financial taxonomy extension to a financial data model.
