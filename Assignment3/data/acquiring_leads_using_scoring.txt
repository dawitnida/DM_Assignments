Acquiring Leads Using Scoring . Effective acquisition of high-quality sales leads is provided. Businesses provide scoring criteria, representing the relative importance of a potential customer's attributes, such as sales revenue, number of employees, industry, geographic location, etc. A scoring engine determines a score for the combination of a potential customer and one or more businesses by applying the criteria in the business' quality profile to the attribute values provided by the potential customer. If the score exceeds a threshold, information about the potential customer is provided to the business at a customized price. The business can then purchase contact information for the potential customer. If the business does not pursue the potential customer, the lead may be offered to additional businesses in a secondary marketplace. A business that agrees to have rejected leads contributed to the secondary marketplace can be issued a credit against past or future leads purchases.
