Forming agricultural transactions to share risk and reward . The invention is directed to techniques in which a producer of an agricultural commodity and a lender agree to share future risks, benefits, or both in a loan transaction. In addition to agreeing to a repayment of principal, the agricultural producer agrees to additional consideration, such as payment of a higher interest rate or a fee, or a promise to share the benefit of a high market price. In exchange for the consideration, the lender agrees to provide some protection from a low market price, or to adjust the terms of the loan to favor the agricultural producer.
