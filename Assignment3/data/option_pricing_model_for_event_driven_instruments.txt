OPTION PRICING MODEL FOR EVENT DRIVEN INSTRUMENTS . Systems and methods are provided for valuing event driven option contracts. A jump diffusion based model, such as a Merton jump diffusion based model, is modified to assume arithmetic movement of an underlying price and a single jump. The arithmetic movement of the underlying price may be modeled with a Bachelier based arithmetic model. Calculated values may be used to determine margin account requirements.
