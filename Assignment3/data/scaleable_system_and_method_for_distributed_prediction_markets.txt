SCALEABLE SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DISTRIBUTED PREDICTION MARKETS . Systems, methods, and software are disclosed to implement distributed prediction markets over the internet. A central platform executes web application software to host prediction markets (FIG. 1A), each of which can be initiated via a widget on a remote web site such as a blogger site (FIG. 1B). A widget communicates with the central server to provide user interface (FIG. 3) to find and select markets and get updates (FIG. 5), and enables a user to register (FIG. 4), bit on markets (propositions), and create their own propositions to become prediction market instances. The central platform provides scalable market provisioning (602, 612), market execution (620, 624), market instance relationships (610), and market closing functions, such as computing rankings (660) and payoffs (650).
