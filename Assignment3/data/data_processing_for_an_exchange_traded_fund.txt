Data processing for an exchange traded fund . An accounting system allows posting transactions to a general ledger of an Exchange Traded Fund. The accounting system includes a computer-assisted process that nets subscription and redemption orders that occurred over a particular time (e.g., one day) and records a transfer of securities into or out of the fund based on the net of the subscription and redemption orders.
