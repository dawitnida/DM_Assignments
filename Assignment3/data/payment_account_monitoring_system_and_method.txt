PAYMENT ACCOUNT MONITORING SYSTEM AND METHOD . A network includes an account status system for checking the status of checking accounts used to make payments, and a payment account monitoring system that includes linking files that store, for individual credit card accounts, the account numbers for checking accounts used to pay the credit card accounts. The monitoring system periodically retrieves checking account numbers from the linking files and checks the account numbers at the status system. If a negative status is indicated at the status system, an alert is provided to the credit card company.
