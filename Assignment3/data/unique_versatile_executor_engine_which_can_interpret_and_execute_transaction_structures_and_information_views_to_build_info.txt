Unique versatile executor engine which can interpret and execute transaction structures and information views to build information systems . This invention is concerned with building information system for enterprises. It has a unique versatile executor engine, which can interpret and execute transaction structures and information views. The information system thus built can grow along with the needs of the enterprise. The novelty lies in the new methodology that has been evolved to build information systems with the executor engine. An information system built in this methodology will allow online and on site creation of new options and changing the existing options without any down time. Profit 5RM incorporates a unique technology, which enables an information system to be built without writing software programs. This makes information system building simple and quick. The data is analyzed and split into transaction structures and information views. These are then defined using the PROFIT 5RM builder, which stores these definitions as data. This is intercepted and executed by the unique executor engine to provide the necessary information. The architecture of the system is described in FIG. 1.
