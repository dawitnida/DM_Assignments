A request may be received to perform an action on an asset identified in the database. In response to the request, a determination is made as to whether the request is to perform an action on a digital or non-digital asset. If the request is to perform an action on a digital asset, a first workflow is performed for completing the action on the digital asset. If the request is to perform an action on a non-digital asset, a second workflow is performed for completing the requested action on the non-digital asset.
