Secured financial transaction device . An electronic device provides a trusted computing platform for authenticating online financial transactions. In one implementation, financial terms are enciphered by a financial entity using a key that is unknown to the user's computer and transmitted over a network to the user's computer. The device receives the enciphered terms from the user's computer and deciphers the terms. The device is equipped with a display to present the deciphered terms and one or more input mechanisms to allow the user to approve or cancel the transaction based on the terms presented on the device's display. The device enciphers the user's reply and returns it to the financial entity via the user's computer.
