Method and apparatus for providing home equity financing without interest payments . A method of financing is provided for the purchase of real estate property, in which a portion of a down payment is provided by an equity financing provider, in return for a right to a portion of the future change in value of the property. The home purchaser does not make any periodic payments to the equity financing provider; only when the equity financing rights are redeemed does the equity financing provider typically receive payment. The equity financing provider also can supply similar equity financing when an existing home owner wishes to raise capital by using the existing equity in the home; instead of obtaining a second mortgage (or a home equity line of credit), the home owner can obtain equity financing from the equity financing provider, in return for a right to a portion of the future change in value of the property.
