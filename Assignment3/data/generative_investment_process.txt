Generative Investment Process . A generative investment process method and system is disclosed for managing investment opportunities. The process applies recursive decomposition to investment opportunities and applies a discrete combinatorial model to the resulting combinatorial investment portfolio, enabling evaluation of existing opportunities and generation of new opportunities. The process may apply decision analysis, value of information analysis, design of experiment models, and inferencing of gathered information, including experimental results. The process enables an efficient and adaptive approach to attaining additional information and assimilating the attained information into the investment opportunity decision process.
