Method and system for providing tax based services to customers . A method for assessing taxes for a machine includes collecting machine data from a machine configured to send the machine data to a remote location and determining a first geographic location of the machine based on the machine data. The method also includes determining a first tax due for the machine based on the first geographic location and a first set of tax rules associated with the first geographic location. Before the first tax is due, an analysis may be performed to evaluate whether the first tax can be reduced by moving the machine to a different tax jurisdiction. Based on the results of the analysis, a determination regarding whether to move the machine to the different tax jurisdiction may be made. Information reflecting the determination whether to move the machine to the different geographic location may be provided.
