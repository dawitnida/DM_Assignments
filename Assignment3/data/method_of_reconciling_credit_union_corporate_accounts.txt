Method of reconciling credit union corporate accounts . A method implemented in software form for reconciling a credit union member's monthly G/L Statement with the Corporate Statement of a corporate credit union. The method generally comprises the steps of inputting the G/L Statement and the Corporate Statement data, reformatting and indexing the same in a particular manner, and performing a sort routine on the indexed, thereby sorting said data into discrete records according to transaction type. A number of pre-determined reports are available inclusive of those in which each sorted and indexed record from the G/L Statement is compared with a corresponding sorted and indexed record from the Corporate Statement data, inclusive of preliminary reconciliation reports compiled from the matching record(s) and unmatched records. The preliminary reconciliation reports are canvassed for matching errors and, once corrected, final reconciliation reports are output. The segregating and indexing of the above-described method reduces the number of machine code comparisons significantly and speeds processing time.
