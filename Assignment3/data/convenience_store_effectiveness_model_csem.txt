Convenience store effectiveness model (CSEM) . The Convenience Store Effectiveness Model (CSEM) is a self-contained PC desktop application enabling an analyst to quantitatively predict the operational and financial impact of changes to Convenience Store (CStore) and Financial Services Center (FSC) operations. This application, according to the present invention, includes a Simulation Analysis Module and a Financial Analysis Module. The Simulation Module consists of two simulation models: FSC model and CStore model. An analyst can use the CStore model to predict the effect of an unlimited number of changes in store design, customer demand patterns, and checkout procedures on store performance. The Financial Analysis Module allows the user to create a Profit and Loss (P&L) statement showing the cash flows, Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for deploying FSCs using simulation results or user input values. An analyst can use the CSEM to provide a sound and quantified basis for developing a business case for investing in new technologies, i.e., FSC, or other design and procedure changes in a convenience store environment.
