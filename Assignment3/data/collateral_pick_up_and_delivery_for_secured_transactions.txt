COLLATERAL PICK-UP AND DELIVERY FOR SECURED TRANSACTIONS . Systems and methods for facilitating secured loan transactions are provided. Drivers of a fleet of parcel delivery vehicles associated with a particular common carrier are used to pick up collateral from a borrower to secure a loan. A driver visits the borrower's address as part of executing parcel delivery transactions to pick up the collateral. The driver may verify the borrower's identity and the validity of the collateral when receiving the collateral. An indication of the receipt of the borrower's collateral is provided to a system accessible by a lending facilitator, such as via the driver's DIAD. The indication can be used by the peer-to-peer lending facilitator to determine a level of risk associated with entering into a loan transaction with the borrower and/or an interest rate for the loan. In some cases, the collateral is delivered to a third party escrow service.
