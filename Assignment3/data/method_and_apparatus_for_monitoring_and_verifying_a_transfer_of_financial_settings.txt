METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING AND VERIFYING A TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL SETTINGS . One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that monitors and verifies a transfer of financial settings. During operation, the system receives a request to transfer a set of financial settings from an initial account to a destination account. In response to the transfer request, the system transfers the financial settings and then monitors the initial account following the transfer to determine whether any subsequent transactions occur. If so, the system analyzes each subsequent transaction to determine whether the subsequent transaction is associated with the transferred financial settings. By monitoring and analyzing subsequent transactions, the system verifies the success of the transfer.
