Systems and methods for determining optimal utilization levels in a fixed capacity system . A method. The method includes includes determining a hardware efficiency factor for an asset having a fixed capacity and a predictable capacity consumption rate, and determining a touch efficiency factor for the asset. The touch efficiency factor represents a measurement of the frequency of touch of the asset, and touch represents a disruption of the asset occurring when the asset reaches the fixed capacity. The method further includes determining an optimal utilization level based on both the hardware efficiency factor and the touch efficiency factor.
