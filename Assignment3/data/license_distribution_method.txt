License distribution method . A license distribution system and a license distribution method for selling/purchasing a license securely are provided. When a purchase request of a license for viewing digital contents is received via a network from a client terminal, a reception window terminal of a storefront server receives the purchase request of a license and executes a process of settling accounts at a first stage. Then, a proof of purchase is issued and the license is sent in exchange for the proof of purchase. Accordingly, no mistake is made in acquiring money at the time of selling the license, and further a table and a process for checking whether charging is made or not are not necessary for a license selling process, thus an operational process and a process program can be simplified and a memory can be used effectively. A license for a subscription commodity and/or a package commodity can be purchased and/or sold as well.
