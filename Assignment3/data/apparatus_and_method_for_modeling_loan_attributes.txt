APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MODELING LOAN ATTRIBUTES . A method, system, and computer program product for generating a model for predicting loan behavior, including receiving loan data for a plurality of loans; preparing the loan data for analysis; grouping the loans into a plurality of hierarchical segments based on shared characteristics; generating a logistic regression model for each segment; and generating an overall prediction model for at least one of prepayment, delinquency, and default across the plurality of segments. Grouping the loans into a plurality of segments based on shared characteristics may include grouping the loans based on loan type, change in Housing Price Index (HPI) since origination, and loan age. Generating a logistic regression model for each segment may include generating a regression model for the probabilities of each of prepayment, default, and delinquency for each of the segments.
