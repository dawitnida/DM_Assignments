Method and system for tracking derivatives positions and monitoring credit limits . A derivatives position tracking system that consists of a centralized trading engine with a trade history database capable of communication with a plurality of counterpart computers via a network to enable the execution of a derivatives transaction. The trading engine and counterpart computers enable the counterpart computers to initiate, unwind and assign requests. Upon execution of a tear-up or assignment, a record of such transaction is stored in the trade history database. Whether or not the tear-up or assignment is executed with the original counterpart, the original counterpart receives a notification of the tear-up/assignment and a new position with the counterpart is reflected in the position-tracking database. Additionally, a credit monitoring module can be used in connection with the derivatives position tracking system to enable the trading engine to alert counterparts when a derivatives transaction exceeds a pre-defined credit limit.
