Methods and systems for fund raising . Various embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems for raising funds for organizations, and in particular cases, non-profit organizations. Merely by way of example, one set of embodiments provides, in a relationship between a product provider and a non-profit organization, a method of providing funding for the non-profit organization. Another set of embodiments includes systems which can, in a relationship between a product provider and an organization (including, for example, a non-profit organization), provide funding under a fund raising program for the organization. Such systems can comprise a processor, an interface in communication with the processor, and a computer readable medium in communication with the processor. The interface can be configured to interact with a user. Merely by way of example, the interface can comprise a web interface and/or a telephonic interface (which may include an integrated voice response system).
