INCOME CURTAILMENT PROTECTION . A method includes enrolling a borrower in income curtailment protection associated with a loan, where the loan requires periodic payments in order for the borrower to avoid defaulting on the loan. If income curtailment has occurred, a determination is made as to what portion of the periodic payment is to be covered on behalf of the borrower. The determined portion of the periodic payment is covered by an entity other than the borrower on behalf of the borrower.
