IMS DEVICE OPERABLE FOR FINANCIAL TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION AND ID CARDS DISPLAY . IMS networks and methods are disclosed for authorizing financial transactions. Credit card information, debit card information, and other purchasing data may be consolidated into an IMS device for conducting financial transactions, such as the purchasing of items from a merchant. Before a financial transaction can be completed, an IMS device transmits transaction data for the financial transaction to the IMS network. The IMS network then processes predefined purchasing rules to determine whether or not the financial transaction is authorized. If the financial transaction is authorized, then the IMS network transmits a confirmation message to the IMS device indicating that the financial transaction is authorized. If the financial transaction is not authorized, then the IMS network transmits a cancel message to the IMS device indicating that the financial transaction is not authorized.
