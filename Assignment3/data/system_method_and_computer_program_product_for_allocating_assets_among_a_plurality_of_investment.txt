System, method, and computer program product for allocating assets among a plurality of investments to guarantee a predetermined value at the end of a predetermined time period . A system, method, and computer program product for allocating assets among a plurality of investments to guarantee a predetermined value at the end of a predetermined time period, the system comprising a processor, a memory, and a computer program stored in the memory. The computer program controls the allocation of assets in the investment vehicle, which allows the investor to initially invest one hundred percent of the initial deposit in non-secure, high risk investments, such as for example mutual funds and/or stocks. At the end of the each trading day, the computer program determines if assets should be reallocated from the non-secure investments to the secure investments, from the secure investments to the non-secure investments, or if no reallocation is necessary. The computer program reallocates assets from the non-secure investment(s) to the secure investment(s) if, at the end of a trading day, the computer program determines that the guaranteed account value would not be met if the non-secure investments were to experience a first predetermined depreciation during the next trading day and all of the depreciated assets of the non-secure investments were transferred to the secure investments for the remainder of the predetermined time period. Alternately, the computer program reallocates assets from the secure investments to the non-secure investments, if the computer program determines that the guaranteed account value would still be met even if the non-secure investments were to experience a second predetermined depreciation during the next trading day and all of the depreciated assets of the non-secure investments were reallocated to the secure investment for the remainder of the predetermined time period. If neither of these conditions is met, then the computer program does not reallocate assets.
