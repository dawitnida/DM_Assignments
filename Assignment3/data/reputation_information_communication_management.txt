Reputation, Information & Communication Management . Methods and a system are described for communication and information management. The methods create and manage multi-factor multi-level reputations, detect and manage fraudulent and manipulative behavior, permit management of information and communications, quantify qualitative information, and derive derivative uses (such as prediction and targeted advertising) from multi-factor reputations, data and behavior. The system described is hierarchical with progressive information and communication management capabilities as reputations increase. The structure of the system is designed to assist reputation calculations.
