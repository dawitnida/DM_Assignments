Automated method of and system for identifying, measuring and enhancing categories of value for a value chain . An automated method and system (100) for identifying, measuring and enhancing categories of value for the different levels of a value chain on a continual basis. The categories of value are analyzed at each level in the value chain using predictive models and vector creation algorithms to define the enterprise and element vectors before valuing the organization, each enterprise in the organization and the elements of value in each enterprise. The relative strengths of the intangible elements of value are used in evaluating the real options of each enterprise and in determining the allocation of industry real options to the enterprise and the organization before summary reports are prepared, displayed and optionally printed. The system then generates potential value improvements which the user (20) optionally accepts, rejects or modifies before simulations are completed to analyze the value impact of the enhancements.
