Systemic investment data analysis . A system and method for outputting hypothetical investment defining data (411) are provided by the present invention. The system comprises a plurality of networked terminals (101 to 104), each of which is configured with at least processing means (208), memory means (209), networking means (211, 212) and visual display means (202). The memory means (209) stores at least a local instantiation (409) of a network-distributable, updateable data structure and instructions (403), which configure the processing means of at least one terminal to obtain (304) financial data (410) from at least another one of the networked terminals (103) by means of the networking means (212). The local data structure instantiation (409) is updated (501) with the financial data (410) obtained. Data in the data structure instantiation (409) is processed with a plurality of data processing functions (404 to 407), wherein the data processing functions define a systemic financial data process (502 to 507). Processed systemic data (411) is output (306) to the visual display means (202) or to another of the networked terminals (104), as hypothetical investment defining data and the local instantiation (409) is either removed from the memory means or further remote financial data (410) is requested.
