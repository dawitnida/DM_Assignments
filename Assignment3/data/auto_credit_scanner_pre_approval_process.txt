Auto credit scanner pre-approval process . The present invention includes an automated credit approval process that provides a pre-approval package based upon information gathered from a basic form of customer identification. A potential customer provides a basic form of personal information, such as a driver's license, to a vendor. The basic personal information is scanned into a data management system where it is subsequently transferred to a credit reporting agency through an automated credit server. The automated credit approval server includes a decisioning platform that compares at least one of a plurality of credit attributes contained within a credit file received from the credit reporting agency with a pre-determined set of creditworthiness criteria established by various lending institutions to generate a credit decision. This method of credit evaluation is conducted with only the basic information found on the driver's license and, as such, limits exposure of the potential customer's sensitive personal information, for example, their social security number and/or signature.
