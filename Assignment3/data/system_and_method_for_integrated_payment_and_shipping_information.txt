System and method for integrated payment and shipping information . "A product distribution module integrated with a payment module. Actions in the distribution module trigger actions in the payment module. For example, a user clicking a ""buy"" button triggers the creation of a product mailer for a seller, and triggers the payment module to collect and hold the purchase price and shipping costs from the buyer. Acceptance of delivery by the buyer, or the expiration of a time-out period after tracking delivery by the distribution module, triggers release of the purchase price to the seller. A ""shared responsibility"" return method and system is also provided. The buyer has until a time out period to object to the product. If the buyer objects, in the buyer's discretion the product can be returned, but the buyer is required to pay a portion of the return shipping costs subject to an algorithm."
