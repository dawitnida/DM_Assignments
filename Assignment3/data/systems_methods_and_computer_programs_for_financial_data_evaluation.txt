Systems, methods and computer programs for financial data evaluation . Systems and methods are provided for evaluating financial information, including systems and methods with computational/evaluation capability to process data sets comprising financial data. In one of the implementations, the systems and methods may be utilized for asset accounting. A calculation module may be provided that includes an evaluation engine that operates internally on a flat, generic data structure that is independent of the particular application. The externally-defined data structure of the data set may be mapped onto the internal data structure. Further, rules-based modules may provide information related to the client-defined rules. A user interface may enable a user to receive back the evaluated financial information, for a specified time period, the financial information being responsive to an original user request entered via the user interface. As a result, the evaluation engine can be used for a variety of different applications.
