Lunar and planetary land property allocation method and system . A method and system for allocating parcels of land property located on a planetary body such as the Moon, such parcels being sub-divisions of extensive parts of land on the planetary body that have previously been subjected to government sponsored manned spacecraft landings and the subsequent site explorations and surveys. Such explorations, when survey-referenced to well-defined manned-spacecraft landing sites, provide the potential for a government to claim extensive parts of land and subsequently exercise an option to grant parcels to individuals for the purpose of encouraging government-beneficial land development. The availability of manned-landing site survey reference points enables sub-division of the land into parcels whose individual locations and boundaries can be precisely defined in a land grant. Individual requests for land parcels to be granted by the government would be expected to be more likely to be approved when such claims are supported by a document, to be called a Deed of Claim, which includes a precise location and boundary description of the requested parcel. This method and system provide for both the sub-division of a large area of land into parcels by a primary business entity, the parcels being precisely described in terms of location and boundary with respect to a government survey reference position; and the subsequent offer for sale of a Deed Of Claim incorporating such a description to individuals wanting to own a parcel description in anticipation of requesting a government-provided grant of the parcel on the basis of owning the Deed Of Claim.
