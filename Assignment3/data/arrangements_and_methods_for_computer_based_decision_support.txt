Arrangements and methods for computer based decision support . The present invention relates to computer arrangements and methods for investment decision support. An advice database comprises a plurality of records for storing advice messages relating to pieces of investment advice. An advice evaluation mechanism is operable to use a set of criteria having at least one variable parameter for evaluating an advice message by determining the variable parameter in response to the advice message, checking whether the plurality of records fulfill the set of criteria and generating an evaluation result based on the result of the checking. A criteria optimization mechanism can be used to optimize the set of criteria to be used in the advice evaluation mechanism.
