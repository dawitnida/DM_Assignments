Computer based system to generate data for implementing regional and metropolitan economic, land use and transportation planning . The present invention comprises a method for forecasting future economic conditions, land utilization and transportation network utilization and performance of a metropolitan area having a plurality of economic zones, the method includes the steps of: a) receiving a set of calibration values from a first input device; b) calculating a set of calibration constants with a first arithmetic logic unit; c) receiving a set of initial values for a set of desired outputs from a second input device, wherein the set of desired outputs includes regional economic, land use and transportation outputs; d) calculating the regional economic and land use outputs with a second arithmetic logic unit, wherein the regional economic and land use outputs include a first group of variable travel demands; e) calculating an origin to destination matrix with a third arithmetic logic unit, wherein the origin to destination matrix includes two-way daily person trips between an origin economic zone and a destination economic zone; f) calculating the transportation outputs with a fourth arithmetic logic unit, wherein the transportation outputs include a second group of variable travel demands; h) repeating steps d) through f) until the first group of variable travel demands is substantially the same as the second group of variable travel demands; and, g) providing the set of desired outputs to an output device.
