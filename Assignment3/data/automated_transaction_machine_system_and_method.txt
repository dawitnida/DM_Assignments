Automated transaction machine system and method . An automated transaction machine (20) with a cross-vender software and hardware platform architecture. The machine includes a computer (22) and a plurality of transaction function devices (32) in operative connection with the computer. The machine further includes a plurality of device driver components (38) that generally correspond to each of the transaction function devices. The device drivers are operative responsive to communication from an XFS layer (28) to control the operation of the transaction function devices. The machine further includes a terminal application (22) and an ODS layer (26). The ODS layer includes a plurality of ODS components (36) that generally correspond to the device drivers and/or transaction function devices. The ODS components responsive to the terminal application are operative to have the device drivers control the operation of the transaction function devices through communication with the XFS layer.
