Method and system for obtaining and financing exclusive real estate listings . A method of obtaining a seller's exclusive real estate listing for a property. The method comprises providing consideration to the seller, for example, in the form of an up-front payment, and receiving from the seller the exclusive real estate listing of the property, the exclusive real estate listing being for an exclusivity time period. If a sale condition, such as receipt of a bona fide purchase offer or a contract for sale, for the property is met during the exclusivity time period, the real estate agent receives return consideration, such as a refund of at least a portion of the consideration.
