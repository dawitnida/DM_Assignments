Data totaling using interval-based subtotals . A method and apparatus for generating a grand total. First totaled values that correspond to respective first intervals within a range of intervals are generated. Second totaled values that correspond to respective second intervals within the range of intervals are also generated, each of the second totaled values including at least one of the first totaled values and each of the second intervals encompassing at least one of the first intervals. A value that indicates a sub-range within the range of intervals is obtained, and a grand total is generated by totaling the second totaled values for which the corresponding second intervals are encompassed by the sub-range and the first totaled values for which the corresponding first intervals are encompassed by the sub-range, excluding the first totaled values that are included in the second totaled values for which the corresponding second intervals are encompassed by the sub-range.
