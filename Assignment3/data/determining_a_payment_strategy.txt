DETERMINING A PAYMENT STRATEGY . Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and apparatuses for determining, recommending, and/or executing a payment strategy. For example, in some embodiments, a method is provided for determining a payment strategy for using at least some funds from a first account to make two or more payments on a second account during a single pay period. In such embodiments, the method includes: (1) determining that the second account includes a payment due date and a minimum payment due; (2) determining a number of payments to make on the second account; (3) determining a payment amount for each payment, such that the total payment amount for all of the payments is sufficient to at least offset the minimum payment due; and (4) determining a triggering event for each payment, such that each of the payments is made on or before the payment due date.
