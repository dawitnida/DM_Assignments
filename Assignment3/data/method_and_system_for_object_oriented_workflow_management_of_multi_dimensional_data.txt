Method and system for object-oriented workflow management of multi-dimensional data . "Methods and systems for managing and analyzing multi-dimensional data are provided. Example embodiments provide a Meta-Object Data Management System ""MODMS,"" which enables users to arrange and to rearrange the hierarchical relationships of the data on an ad-hoc basis and allows the data to be analyzed using any set of attributes (dimensions) while the system is running. The MODMS represents heterogeneous data in a normalized (standardized) fashion using an object type management system that allows the coercion of one type of object into another different type of object and automatically resolves attribute dependencies. The MODMS supports object transitions for transforming an object from one type to another based upon meeting a defined set of criteria and subject to approval by designated entities. In one embodiment, the MODMS is used to implement an enterprise portfolio management system."
