Method and system for creating and trading derivative investment products based on a statistical property reflecting the variance of an underlying asset . A system and method for creating a limited risk derivative based on a realized variance of an underlying equity is disclosed. In one implementation, a limited risk derivative product includes a capped value for a statistical property reflecting a variance of the underlying equity is calculated based on a pari-mutuel action. The capped value comprises a dynamic value and a cap. The dynamic value reflects an average volatility of prices returns of the underlying equity over a predefined period of time and the cap reflects a maximum value of the dynamic value. The limited risk derivative product additionally includes an average of a summation of each squared daily return of the underlying equity included in the value for the statistical property reflecting the variance of the underlying equity.
