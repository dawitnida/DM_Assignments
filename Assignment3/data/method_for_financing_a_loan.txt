Method for financing a loan . A method for financing a product or service that includes determining a first loan amount and calculating a first periodic payment and a first term based on the first loan amount. The method further includes determining a supplemental allowance for a borrower and calculating a revised loan amount by summing the first loan amount and the supplemental allowance. Once the revised loan amount is determined, a revised periodic payment and a revised loan term based on said revised loan amount are determined; and the revised loan term is reduced by applying a second periodic payment schedule based one of the first periodic payment and the revised periodic payment.
