Method and system for identifying and managing currency exposure . A method and system for identifying and managing currency exposure is provided. In certain implementations, a company's accounting data, including the data of its subordinate entities, is uploaded to one or more servers. Each entity's foreign currency exposures are calculated. Foreign currency exposures of different entities that offset one another may be netted. Similar currency exposures are summed across all entities. Each resulting currency exposure is converted to the company's reporting currency. The converted currency exposures of the entities are summed together to report the gross currency exposure for the company. To calculate the overall net currency exposure for the company, the value of the currency-based derivatives represented in the company's reporting currency is subtracted from the gross currency exposures of the company. The overall net currency exposure for the company is displayed on a web interface, along with possible courses of action that may be taken to bring the company into compliance with currency exposure policies. The user may request that displayed actions be taken. If such a request is made, an electronic message is generated and sent to one or more persons who are authorized to approve the requested actions. When the company approves a suggested currency action, the system executes the currency transaction in such a way as to ensure price execution quality. The system then sends a transaction confirmation and settlement report to the company and reconciles the currency transactions and positions with the executing counterparty.
