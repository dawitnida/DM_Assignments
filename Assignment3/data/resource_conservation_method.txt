Resource conservation method . A resource conservation method, including commodity market exchanges in furtherance thereof, is provided. Carbon dioxide is acquired from at least one carbon dioxide source for recycling the carbon dioxide. Valuable consideration is received for the acquisition of the carbon dioxide, with carbon dioxide provided, for valuable consideration, from a supply of the acquired carbon dioxide to growing plants for adsorption thereby in furtherance of photosynthesis. Water generally consumed by the growing plants is reduced and thus conserved, whereby financial incentives motivate carbon dioxide recycling and water conservation, thereby bringing arid land into productive use.
