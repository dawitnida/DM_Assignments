Distributed system and brokering method using context . A distributed system in which a plurality of devices are coupled to each other through a network, includes a service scenario which describes functions necessary to provide a service and relations between the functions in general description; a context which serves as a criterion for selecting devices to be used in providing the service; an extraction unit which extracts devices necessary for the service based on the service scenario; a detection unit which detects devices located in a site where the service can be provided to a service requester; and a service execution unit which executes the service for the service requester by linking the devices detected based on the context.
