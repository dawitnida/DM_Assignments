Recalculation as a function of changed data . A process to evaluate selected data is started. An earliest effective date of changed selected data is determined, and data generated by prior run processes occurring after the earliest effective data is recalculated. In one embodiment, a coarse exclusive lock may be used to ensure only one evaluation is processed until completed. A fine exclusive lock may be used on a record which is the subject of a currently running evaluation process. In a further embodiment, a coarse lock is used on the data, and no lock is required for other evaluation processes. In yet a further embodiment, a snapshot of data prior to change is used during a predetermined security period.
