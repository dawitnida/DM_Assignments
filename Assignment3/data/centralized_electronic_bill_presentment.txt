Centralized electronic bill presentment . To make bill information available for presentation to a user entity, a first network site receives a request of the user entity for bill information, from a third network site associated with the user entity. In response, bill information representing a bill of a biller entity for the user entity is retrieved from storage at a second network site associated with a bill information provider entity, such as a biller. The retrieved bill information is transmitted, from the first network site to the third network site, for presentation to the user entity at the third network site. The first, the second, and the third network sites are different network sites.
