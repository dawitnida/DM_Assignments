Computer-based transaction system and computer implemented method for transacting services between a service provider and a client . A computer-based transaction system operated by a service provider includes a stored set of business rules for defining a treaty, a stored set of treaty clauses, and a stored set of service-specific rules. The transaction system is configured to receive and store business-initiating data from a client via a telecommunications network. The transaction system generates automatically a treaty document by applying the business rules to the business-initiating data to select the treaty clauses forming the treaty document. Furthermore, the transaction system selects automatically service-specific rules related to the treaty clauses forming the treaty document. A message management module is configured to map automatically electronic messages received from the client into a data format, defined by the service provider, based on metadata, defined by the selected service-specific rules.
