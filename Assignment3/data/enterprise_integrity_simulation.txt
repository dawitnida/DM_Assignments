Enterprise integrity simulation . Methods and apparatus, including computer program products, for risk assessment and analysis. Asset data representing a set of assets is received. Threat data representing a set of threats is received. Measures data representing a set of measures is received. A loss expectancy based upon the value of the assets, the potential reduction of value caused by the threats, and the protection of the value caused by the measures is automatically calculated. Project data representing a simulated project is received. A revised loss expectancy is automatically calculated based upon the value of the assets, the potential reduction of value caused by the threats, and the protection of the value caused by the measures as modified by the simulated project. A savings caused by the simulated project is automatically calculated based upon the loss expectancy and revised loss expectancy.
