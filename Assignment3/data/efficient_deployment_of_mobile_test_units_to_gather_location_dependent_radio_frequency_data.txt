Efficient Deployment of Mobile Test Units to Gather Location-Dependent Radio-Frequency Data . A technique for designing and testing drive-test plan for gathering location-dependent RF data is disclosed. In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, one candidate drive-test plan is chosen for implementation over a second based on an economic cost-benefit analysis of both plans. This is in marked contrast to, for example, a selection of drive-test plans, or the design of a drive-test plan, based on a calibration-cost analysis, in which the data estimated to be the most effective to calibrate a radio-frequency tool is sought for a given cost or the least cost. Although a data-estimated-to-be-most-effective-to-calibrate-a-radio-frequency-tool vs. cost analysis is a species of cost-benefit analyses in general, it is not an economic cost-benefit analysis because a data-estimated-to-be-most-effective-to-calibrate-a-radio-frequency-tool vs. cost analysis has deficiencies that an economic cost-benefit analysis does not.
