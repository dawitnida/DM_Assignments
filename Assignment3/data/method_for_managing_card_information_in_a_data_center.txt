Method for managing card information in a data center . Card information is managed in a data center interposed between a plurality of financial institutions which issue cards and users which use the issued cards. The data center registers card information including card numbers and card status information into a database correspondingly to user IDs established in advance. The data center checks a user ID transmitted from a terminal operated by corresponding one of the users with each of user IDs registered in the database. As a result of the checking, if there is a registered user ID coinciding with the transmitted user ID, the data center invalidates card status information corresponding to at least one card selected by the user out of card information of the user. Then, the data center transmits a request to invalidate the selected card to a corresponding financial institution which has issued the selected card while designating card number of the card.
