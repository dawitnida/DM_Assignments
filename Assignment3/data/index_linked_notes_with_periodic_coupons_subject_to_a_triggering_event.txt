INDEX-LINKED NOTES WITH PERIODIC COUPONS SUBJECT TO A TRIGGERING EVENT . Index-linked notes with periodic coupons subject to a triggering event, and accompanying methods, are described herein. In some instances, exemplary notes allow a purchaser to purchase a note and receive periodic coupons returned on the note as long as a triggering event does not occur. Assuming that the triggering event does not occur, the purchaser may receive these coupons until the note reaches maturity. Payment of the periodic coupons may cease, however, when a triggering event (e.g., the purchaser's death) does occur. In addition, the amount of the periodic coupons are tied in some manner to a financial index, such as the Bloomberg index, the S&P 500, or the like.
