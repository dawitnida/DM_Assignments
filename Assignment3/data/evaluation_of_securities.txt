Evaluation of securities . A method for evaluating securities comprises the steps of estimating a P/E ratio for a security that will yield a predetermined rate of return on an investment in said security, inputting an actual historical P/E ratio for the security, determining a merit rating for the security as a function of the estimated P/E ratio and of the historical P/E ratio of the security; and displaying the merit rating in a perceptible form.
