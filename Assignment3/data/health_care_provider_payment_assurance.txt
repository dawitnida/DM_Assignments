Health care provider payment assurance . A process for providing payment of a patient's share of health care treatment and products comprises issuing a medical expense credit card to the patient, wherein payments charged are not made until approved by a third party administrator. An audit of charges is performed by a third party administrator and payment is released if the charges and the patient's share are approved by the administrator. Fees can be deducted from the payments when they are made.
