SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ISSUING AND MONITORING BONDS AND OTHER CONTROLLED DOCUMENTS . A system and method for issuing and monitoring controlled forms, and in particular, insurance policies and bonds. The system generally comprises a server computer and a client computer coupled by a communication link, such as the Internet. A controlled form may be created by a user stationed at the client computer, and subsequently reported to a controlled form issuer at the server computer. The method begins with a user selecting a controlled form issuer and a form. The user enters information into fields of one or more data entry screens corresponding to the selected form, and then transmits the entered information to the server computer. Subsequently, the agent receives a completed controlled form from the server computer corresponding to the selected form that may be printed at the client computer and provided to a form applicant. The information entered by the user may also be used to develop a risk score for the form applicant, and the price of the controlled form may be adjusted based upon the risk score. The system may also include separate modules for viewing and editing information associated with agents who use the system, viewing and editing forms stored on the system, and communicating underwriting requests and decisions.
