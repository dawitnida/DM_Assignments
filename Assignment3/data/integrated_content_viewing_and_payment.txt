Integrated content viewing and payment . A content purchaser can freely and fluidly zoom into and out of content at a continuous range of resolutions. The price for the viewed content is calculated using a price function, such as a binary price function, a discrete price function, or a continuous price function. Payment can be made automatically without interrupting the process of viewing the content. If payment cannot be made automatically, various user interfaces may be provided that are integrated with the viewing process for allowing a would-be purchaser to buy the content at any desired resolution.
