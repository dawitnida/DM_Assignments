Vehicle location system . A vehicle location system which operates to provide a location of a vehicle. Specifically, if a payment due date associated with the vehicle has passed and a payment has not been received for the vehicle, the vehicle location system operates to provide the vehicle's location to a service agency. The service agency can then locate and repossess the vehicle. Additionally, the vehicle location system can be activated if it is detected that the vehicle is being tampered with. The location of the vehicle can be determined using global positioning satellites or by triangulation using base stations in mobile radio systems.
