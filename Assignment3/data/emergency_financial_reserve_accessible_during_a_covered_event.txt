EMERGENCY FINANCIAL RESERVE ACCESSIBLE DURING A COVERED EVENT . A system and method for providing emergency reserve conditional credit to a customer of a financial institution. The emergency conditional credit may be provided to the customer in the form of a line-of-credit or a loan based on the occurrence of a predetermined condition, such as involuntary unemployment, disability or the like. The emergency reserve product of the present invention is a product that can be offered through a financial institution or other ER-providing entity and, as such, does not require the level of regulation required of an insurance product. The invention also provides for the emergency reserve product to be offered in conjunction with a debt cancellation feature, referred to as emergency reserve protection, which serves to cancel the outstanding debt associated with the loan or line-of-credit.
