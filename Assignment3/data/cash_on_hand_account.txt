CASH-ON-HAND ACCOUNT . A banking system includes terminals and a computer operable to act as a server on a network and to communicate with each terminal. The computer includes a memory configured to store a set of instructions and a processor configured to execute the instructions. The instructions cause the processor to: receive a deposit request from a terminal, the request comprises an amount of funds to be deposited, and instructions indicating a percentage of the funds to be deposited into a cash-on-hand account; credit the account with an amount of funds equivalent to the percentage of the deposited funds instructed therefor; and transfer funds to a cash-on-hand reserve, wherein the amount of funds transferred to the reserve is equivalent to the amount of funds credited to the account. The funds transferred to the reserve are not eligible for conventional banking activities, and the reserve is only diminished by withdrawals from the account.
