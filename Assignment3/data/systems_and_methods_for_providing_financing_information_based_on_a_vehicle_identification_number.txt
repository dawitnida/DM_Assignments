Systems and methods for providing financing information based on a vehicle identification number . Systems and methods allow a customer to obtain a monthly payment and view possible financing options while shopping for a vehicle on a dealership's lot. A server may receive a VIN, calculate a monthly payment based on customer parameters, and transmit a message to a wireless device being used by the customer. The message may provide a monthly payment amount and possible financing options for a particular vehicle. The customer may also may input parameters, such as a down payment and an amount of a trade-in, if applicable, so that the parameters are taken into consider when determining financing options.
