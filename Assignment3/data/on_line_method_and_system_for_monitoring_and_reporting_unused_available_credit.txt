ON-LINE METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MONITORING AND REPORTING UNUSED AVAILABLE CREDIT . The present invention generally relates to monitoring and advising consumers of their outstanding credit balance by category of debt (i.e. including, but not limited to, the category of all credit cards, all real estate loans, all automotive loans, all revolving credit loans, etc.) and all minimum payments due by category of debt, and more particularly to an on-line method and system for monitoring and reporting total credit used by category of debt, total minimum payments due by category of debt and total unused available credit by category of debt, and alerting the consumer on a periodic basis via email. Since the credit report is the basis of most credit scores this invention is meant to provide the consumer with debt categories that are used in calculating their credit score, which is critical to future borrowing especially when the borrowing is approved or disapproved based only on the user's credit score.
