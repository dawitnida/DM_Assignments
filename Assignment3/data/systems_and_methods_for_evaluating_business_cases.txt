Systems and methods for evaluating business cases . A method of evaluating business cases includes receiving into a computing device configuration information relating to the business case. The method further includes presenting data entry screens for entering data into the model. The data entry screens are tailored, based on the configuration information, to the business case. The methods further includes receiving the information into the computing device by way of the data entry screens. The method further includes processing the data to produce a first outcome from the model and displaying the outcome. A further embodiment of the method includes performing a Monte Carlo simulation based on the business case model. Additional embodiments include a system for implementing the method of evaluating business cases.
