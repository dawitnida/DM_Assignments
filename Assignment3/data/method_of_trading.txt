Method of Trading . A method of borrowing an item from a lender to a borrower, in which the item has an RFID tracking device affixed thereto. While the item is in the possession of the borrower, the lender uses data transmitted from the RFID tracking device to monitor the item, to be assured of its location and security and optionally to compile an inventory of borrowed items. Whilst the item is in the possession of the borrower, the borrower may pay an interest payment to the lender agreed between the borrower and the lender and derived from the monetary value of the item. The borrower may sell the borrowed item to a third party for a price and pay the lender a sum agreed between the borrower and the lender and derived from a monetary value of the item when it is sold.
