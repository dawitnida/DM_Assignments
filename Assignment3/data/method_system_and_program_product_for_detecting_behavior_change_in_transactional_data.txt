Method, system, and program product for detecting behavior change in transactional data . A computer-implemented method, system, and program product for accumulating and analyzing transactional data to detect a behavior change, which may be due to customer dissatisfaction. Specifically, under the present invention, a transactional data value is provided that reflects a measurement of transactions that have occurred in a particular time period. This transactional data value is then incorporated into a running mean and a running square and running standard deviation are computed therefrom. A variance of the transactional data value in terms of the standard deviation is then compared against a threshold to determine whether the transactional data value indicates a change in entity behavior. This allows the determination to be made without the need to store multiple transactional data values. Once a determination has been made that an entity's behavior was changed, the determination may be verified using a transactional data value over a second time period, and/or a communication may be sent to the entity.
