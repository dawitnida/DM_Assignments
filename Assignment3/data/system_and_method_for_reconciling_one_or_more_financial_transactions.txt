System and Method for Reconciling One or More Financial Transactions . A system, method and computer program product for reconciling one or more financial transactions of one or more business units. The method includes capturing transaction data from the financial transactions using a first set of data logics. The capturing further includes extracting the transaction data from the financial transactions using import templates and transforming the extracted transaction data to a predefined format, using a first set of validations. The captured transaction data is then auto-matched with master data as reference, using one or more auto-match logics and a second set of validations. One or more reports are then generated on the auto-matched transaction data. The method further includes providing user privileges for controlling the capturing, the auto-matching, and the generation of the one or more reports according to a first predefined criterion.
