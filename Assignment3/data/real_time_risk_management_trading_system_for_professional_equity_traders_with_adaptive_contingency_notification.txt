REAL-TIME RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING SYSTEM FOR PROFESSIONAL EQUITY TRADERS WITH ADAPTIVE CONTINGENCY NOTIFICATION . The present invention provides traders with a computer-based neural analysis system for trading commodities based on a traders risk profile, particularly equities, by providing a careful selection of the data to analyze and selecting the correct manipulation of that data. The neural analysis component uses initially selected data components or factors, by manipulating them with operators, or asset specific mathematical functions, a fuzzy or Bayesian advisors help to assist in the genetic learning of the system by being reward and punishment based on the correlation to success and failure, or meta-advisors. A contingency notification system implemented either internally or externally examines the real-time data feed to determine if conditions are such that the trader should be notified that conditions have been met, such that the risk profile requires an immediate action.
