Overseas remittance system and overseas remittance service server . When a terminal that can be connected to the Internet directs an overseas remittance unit to remit funds from an account of a financial institution to an account of an overseas financial institution, the overseas remittance unit first, based on this remittance instruction, requests a funds withdrawal unit to withdraw funds from the account of the financial institution. The funds withdrawal unit, in accordance with the request from the overseas remittance unit, withdraws funds from the account of the financial institution and then notifies the overseas remittance unit of the withdrawal. The overseas remittance then requests a funds transfer unit to remit the withdrawn funds to the account of the overseas financial institution. The funds transfer unit, in accordance with the request from the overseas remittance unit, remits the funds that have been withdrawn from the funds withdrawal unit to the account of the overseas financial institution.
