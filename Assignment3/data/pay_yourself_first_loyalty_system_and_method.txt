PAY YOURSELF FIRST LOYALTY SYSTEM AND METHOD . The invention encourages users by providing loyalty points when the users not only pay themselves first, but when the users pay themselves first in the largest amounts possible, even if they are not able to fully pay outstanding debts. In general, the system obtains information related to the user's income, income sources, user's debts (e.g., bills) and user's goals. The system then provides recommendations related to the prioritization of paying certain bills and the amount to pay for each bill based upon, for example, savings goals, minimum amounts due, due dates and available income. The system and/or the user may then determine a payment hierarchy which includes transferring funds to the user's savings account prior to paying all or a portion of certain bills. The system then provides loyalty points to at least one of said user, income source and payee.
