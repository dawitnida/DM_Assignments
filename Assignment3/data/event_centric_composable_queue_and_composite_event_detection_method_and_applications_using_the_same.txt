EVENT-CENTRIC COMPOSABLE QUEUE, AND COMPOSITE EVENT DETECTION METHOD AND APPLICATIONS USING THE SAME . Disclosed herein are an Event-centric Composable Queue (ECQ), and a composite event detection method and applications using the same. The ECQ includes a Composition Link Table (CLT) having basic information about the composition of a network of ECQs, a Shared Instance Queue (SIQ) for storing preceding event objects which are shared by a plurality of detection sentences and which are required for composite event detection, and a Partial Composition Block (PCB) for storing the intermediate results of the calculation of the extent to which each stored event object satisfies a specific composite event detection sentence.
