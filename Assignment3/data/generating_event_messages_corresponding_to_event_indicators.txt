Generating event messages corresponding to event indicators . A transaction entity handles event messages associated with events of interest. At least one type of event is identified that is of interest to a user. Each type of event further corresponds to an event type that is to be repeated by a transaction entity to an aggregating entity. Further, a description is associated with each identified type of event. The transaction entity identifies an occurrence of an event that is an identified type of event and generates an event message comprising a token that associates the user with an account maintained by the aggregating and the description that is associated with the identified type of event corresponding to the identified occurrence of the event. The event message is transmitted to the aggregating entity.
