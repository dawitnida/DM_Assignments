Price grabber . Systems and methods for automatic price monitoring of an online marketplace. The online marketplace is a virtual store (e.g., web-based) for buyers and sellers to exchange goods or products. A system includes a price monitoring module coupled to a market server, and buyer and seller devices. The price monitoring module retains a position garnered by a seller with the lowest price by periodically adjusting a subscribing seller's listing price to beat competing seller prices. The price monitoring module can be configured according to price parameters which gauge how much sellers are willing to concede. The price parameters can include, for example, a default listing price for a product, a decrement amount, a minimum listing price, and the like.
