SYSTEM AND METHOD OF RECORDING, SHARING, AND STORING DATA AND MATERIALS FOR SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL . A method, a process, and a location for a customer to store life-time memories, feelings, emotions, and consciousness, or any other mental activity in a permanent database, based on a financing plan, aided by a collection of personal physical artifacts and personal biological data and materials in permanent physical storage, to share personal and communal information and physical collection with others, to build virtual and permanent personal and collective identities, and to prepare for the possible and probable human immortality where evocation of personal and communal consciousness and information is required when technology avails itself to make our consciousness alive again, either in biological form, in electronic form, in electro-biological form, or in any other possible form, so that our individual consciousnesses will live on both as separate entities and possibly form a unity with one another, in a state of community or singularity, thus achieving immortality.
