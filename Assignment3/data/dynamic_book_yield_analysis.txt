Dynamic book yield analysis . The present invention relates to systems, methods, data structures and user interfaces for generating and presenting information as to how and why the book yield of an investment portfolio changed over a time interval. Dynamic book yield analysis is particularly useful for bond portfolio analysis and management. Transactions and events that occur in a financial market during a pre-specified time period and relating to a portfolio of assets are identified by a computer server. Specifically, the book yields and book values for these transactions and events are accessed from the portfolio accounting system and the data for each transaction/event are categorized according to transaction/event type (though net cash equivalents are first separated out into their own category). The categorized information is then stored in a data structure residing on the system. Book yields and book values are identified for the portfolio of assets at the beginning and end of the pre-specified time period and book yields and book values are calculated for each category of transactions/events previously identified. The effect of each category of transactions/events on the book yield of the portfolio of assets is then quantified. The results of the analysis can then be displayed to investors and portfolio managers in dynamic book yield attribution reports generated by a reporting system. The reports can be used by these investors and portfolio managers to make and execute additional investment decisions based, at least in part, on the quantified impacts of each category of transactions/events on the portfolio book yield.
