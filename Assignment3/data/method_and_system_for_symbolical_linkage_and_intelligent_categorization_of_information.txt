Method and system for symbolical linkage and intelligent categorization of information . The present invention provides a method and system for the archival and retrieval of symbolically and categorically linked information preferably in the form of documents or data records. The method and system enables the archival and retrieval of information despite idiosyncratic symbol usage. A master symbol database stores a plurality of master symbols and a categorical symbol database stores a plurality of categorical symbols, wherein each master symbol and categorical symbol are formatted according to a predetermined structure. Users may archive or retrieve symbolically linked information in an information database by providing an input symbol. If necessary the system normalizes the input symbol where the input symbol may include either or both a master symbol and a categorical symbol. After the input symbol is normalized the system searches either or both the master symbol database and the categorical symbol database in order to find a matching master symbol and a matching categorical symbol. Information is then retrieved or archived base upon either or both the matching master symbol and the matching categorical symbol.
