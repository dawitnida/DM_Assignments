Integrated online help system and buyer-initiated C2C marketplace . "An integrated online help system and buyer-initiated C2C marketplace. A client who is in need of help posts a request (Goods Wanted or Info Wanted) at a client system, including a detailed description of the request and the fees to be paid. The server system notifies a selected group of registered help providers about the request via email. Other users can search at the client system for any open requests and post responses if desired. The help providers are asked to enter a ""guaranteed refund rate"" in their response to facilitate transactions involving merchandise. A set of four methods and procedures support the irreversible transaction involving information. The help providers are required to provide their ""help credentials"", their response's ""projected satisfaction index"", which has an inverse relation to the requester's ""minimum pay rate"". The requester is required to sign a ""contract"", agreeing to the minimum pay rate prior to viewing each response. This online help community, a buyer-initiated C2C online marketplace, is regulated by a user agreement and a peer rating system."
