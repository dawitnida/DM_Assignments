COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED GLOBAL CURRENCY DETERMINATION . Embodiments of the present invention are directed at least in part to a computer-implemented method for determining the value of a global currency. Data indicative of a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) value of each of a plurality of countries is used to select a plurality of countries on the basis of a predetermined criterion, and then relative weightings of the selected countries are evaluated on the basis of their respective GDP values. The global currency is evaluated by combining the evaluated relative weightings with currency values associated with the selected countries.
