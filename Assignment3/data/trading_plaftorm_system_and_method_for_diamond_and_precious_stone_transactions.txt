Trading Plaftorm System and Method for Diamond and Precious Stone Transactions . "The transaction method and system facilitates sales of diamonds or stones. A searchable database of stones includes, for each stone, an offer to sell, a weight-carat, other stone characteristics and an electronic copy of a grading lab certificate which uniquely identifies each stone from all other stones in the database. A search displays, for each stone, the offer and stone weight, stone characteristics and electronic access to the stone's certificate. The system permits a prospective buyer to ""buy now,"" which closes the transaction at the posted offer, or ""bid now"" wherein the system logs a bid value and an expiry time. Other bids are posted and displayed, in a primacy order until (a) the seller ""buy now at the bid"" or (b) withdraws the offer or (c) replaces the offer with a subsequent offer. Preferably, offers: displayed in time sequence and bids: displayed by primacy of price and expiry."
