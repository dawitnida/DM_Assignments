System and Method for Proactively Establishing a Third-Party Payment Account for Services Rendered to a Resident of a Controlled-Environment Facility . "Systems and methods for proactively establishing a third-party payment account for services rendered to a resident of a controlled-environment facility (""CEF""). A campaign-triggering event is detected, which triggers contact of prospective third-party (""3.sup.rd-party"") payers for a resident of a CEF in order to encourage such prospective 3.sup.rd-party payers to establish 3.sup.rd-party payment accounts for the resident. In this manner, the prospective 3.sup.rd-party payers are proactively contacted prior to an expected future demand for service by the resident. A method thus comprises identifying at least one prospective third-party payer for a resident of a controlled-environment facility, and proactively contacting the identified at least one prospective third-party payer prior to demand for service by the resident to encourage the identified at least one prospective third-party payer to establish a third-party payment account for payment for future service expected for the resident."
