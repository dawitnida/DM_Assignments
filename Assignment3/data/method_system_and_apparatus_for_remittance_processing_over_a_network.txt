Method, system, and apparatus for remittance processing over a network . A method, system, and apparatus directed to remittance processing over a network. Information associated with a payment made to a merchant is received at a transaction verification intermediary (TVI). In response to the received information, a payment is made by the TVI to a merchant account at a financial repository of the merchant (FRM). Information about transactions made by the merchant is sent from the TVI to a third party. In response, the third party sends a request to the FRM for remittance of a portion of the merchant's funds managed by the FRM. The portion may be determined by a right to a future percentage of payments made to the merchant. The requested portion of the merchant's fund is debited and sent by the FRM to the third party. Once the total amount of the third party's payments is received, the remittance processing is finalized.
