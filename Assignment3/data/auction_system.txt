Auction system . An integrated system for the sale of personal possessions in conjunction with a home. When engaged by a homeowner, a real estate agent can provide optional sales channels for personal possession associated with the existing home that the homeowner may no longer need or want. Providing significant convenience to the homeowner, the real estate agent/auction entity takes care of all or most of the details with respect to the sales of the goods and generally delivers the money minus commissions to the homeowner. This includes cataloguing the items for sale both visually and verbally as well as obtaining minimum price information from the homeowner. Storage services may also be provided if necessary for the homeowner by the real estate agent/auctioning entity.
