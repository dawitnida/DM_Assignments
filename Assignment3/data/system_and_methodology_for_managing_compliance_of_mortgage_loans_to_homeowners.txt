SYSTEM AND METHODOLOGY FOR MANAGING COMPLIANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS TO HOMEOWNERS . A computer-implemented system and method for mortgage lending management and compliance receives, from a user, lending transaction data for a loan, property and a borrower; automatically determines if the loan complies with legal requirements and/or requires counseling based on the presence of one or more triggers (i.e., indicia of subprime or predatory lending) in the data, and notifying parties of the determination; and receives, from a counselor, counseling data for the loan and borrower. After any necessary counseling has been obtained and the counselor supplies all needed data, a certificate may be generated evidencing a counseling determination. The certificate may be transmitted to an office of a recorder for a jurisdiction in which the property is located. Suspicious activity may be flagged for appropriate investigation and remedial action by an administrator. Further progress may be halted until the administrator provides responsive input.
