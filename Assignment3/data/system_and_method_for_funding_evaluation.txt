System and method for funding evaluation . The funding method and system operates on an information network and has a database of members. A funding event manager solicits member companies or funders to participate in a funding competition. Participating companies provide information, which is systematically filtered to select companies meeting event criteria. Experts, which are also selected from the member database, review the selected companies to choose finalist companies. Information regarding the finalist companies is presented to members in the member database, and responding members evaluate finalist companies. The evaluations are used in selecting one or more of the finalist companies to receive funding.
