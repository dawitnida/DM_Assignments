System And Method For Conducting Account Requests Over A Network Using Natural Language . The invention is directed to a system and method for conducting account requests with a financial institution accessible with a client device over a network. An account is established with the financial institution and a user can access the account via the client device. The client device has a user interface that includes a natural language input. A request is input via the natural language input. The inputting step causes network components (e.g., server 42 and one or more software modules 50) to determine whether the request can be granted. Information respecting the request is transmitted to the user interface. The information includes an indication of whether the request can be granted. The inputting step can cause the network components to query a search engine. In this case the search engine returns search results respecting the request. The request can be generally selected from the group including: a request for historical account information, a request for market price data, a request for analysis information, a request for a purchase of a security, a request for a sale of a security, or a request for status information. The received information respecting the request can include a plurality of transaction choices, ones of which when selected cause the network components to execute steps in furtherance of the request. The received information respecting the request can also include a request for confirmation of the request. The system can access account information associated with the account and use at least a portion of the account information in connection with processing the request.
