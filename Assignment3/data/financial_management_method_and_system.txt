Financial management method and system . A method and system in a remote computer network (80) for interactively managing financial information, wherein the remote computer network (80) has at least one client (92) connectable to one or more servers (88). Initially, a deal center database can be designated wherein deal information is stored (384). An investment management database may be then specified wherein investment management information is stored (386). A financial management database is thereafter established, wherein financial management information is stored (388). Each of the databases are then integrated with one another in the remote computer network (80) to thereby permit users to access information stored in the databases utilizing the remote computer network (80). A deal center interface can then be specified for interactively accessing deal center information stored in the deal center database (390), in addition to an investment management interface for interactively accessing investment management information stored in the investment management information database (392). Finally, a financial management interface is established for interactively accessing financial management information stored in the financial management information database. Each of the interfaces are integrated with one another (394, 396, 398, 400) in the remote computer network to thereby permit users to access information stored in the databases through the interfaces.
