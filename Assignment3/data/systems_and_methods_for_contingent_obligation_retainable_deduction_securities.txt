Systems and methods for contingent obligation retainable deduction securities . A convertible security may include a maturity component, a conversion component, and a contingent component. In general, the maturity component provides a maturity term of no more than five years. The conversion component provides terms and conditions for converting the convertible security for another asset. The contingent component provides one or more contingent payments upon the occurrence of one or more specified conditions. The contingent component is structured to ensure that the convertible security qualifies for treatment as a contingent payment debt instrument under the tax code, wherein the comparable yield of the convertible security is greater than applicable Federal rate (AFR) plus five percentage points.
