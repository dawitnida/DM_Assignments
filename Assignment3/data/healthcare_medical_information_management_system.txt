Healthcare Medical Information Management System . A medical information management system and corresponding methods are described for providing access to healthcare records. The system includes a database system comprising healthcare records of a patient, a healthcare workstation coupled to the database system and an authentication system comprising a processor coupled to the database system. The healthcare workstation is located at a treatment facility or point of treatment that is remote to the database system. The authentication system generates an image of a finger of the patient at the point of treatment, and generates from the image an identification number. The authentication system compares the identification number to a stored number corresponding to the patient, and authenticates the patient's identity when the comparison produces a match between the identification number and stored number. Access to the healthcare records is controlled via the healthcare workstation in response to authentication of the patient.
