Global remittance platform . The invention provides a remittance platform in which an enterprise, such as Wells Fargo, serves as a remittance transfer agent, where the remittance function is integrated with a bank. The invention allows access to the remittance program by both account holders with the enterprise and persons who do not have an account with the enterprise. The person accessing the service may pick the remittance service they want and the country they want. However, the service is not anchored to a particular account and can therefore work with both bank partners and non-bank partners and account holders and non-account holders. Further, the system may be private-labeled. Additionally, the invention provides a mechanism that allows one to send money easily to other countries and it allows bank partners to participate in the program easily as well. This is possible because the enterprise provides all of the processing in an integrated fashion.
