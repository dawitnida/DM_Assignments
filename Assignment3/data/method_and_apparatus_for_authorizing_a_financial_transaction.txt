METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR AUTHORIZING A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION . A system that authorizes a financial transaction is presented. During operation, the system receives a request to authorize accounts associated with one or more financial instruments to be used to fulfill the financial transaction. Next, the system determines a transaction location at which the financial transaction is being performed. The system then determines whether the accounts are authorized to be used at the transaction location. If so, the system authorizes the accounts to be used to fulfill the financial transaction.
