Method and System of Applying Environmental Incentives . "Information relating to electrical energy usage for a given account is associated with a time segment that corresponds to a period when the electrical energy was received from an electrical energy distribution system. Electrical energy generation carbon impact information is retrieved for the corresponding time segment specifying when the electrical energy was received from an electrical energy distribution system. A carbon credit is calculated according to the retrieved electrical energy generation carbon impact information, and the retrieved electrical energy usage information associated with the time segment. The calculated carbon credit is then used to update a display of carbon credit related information, such as account balance, rate of carbon credit usage, currently applicable ""cost"" for carbon credit usage. Notifications can be provided to the consumer if any of this information crosses a threshold value. In addition, or alternatively, the carbon credit related information can be used to automatically control the operation of devices that consume electrical energy."
