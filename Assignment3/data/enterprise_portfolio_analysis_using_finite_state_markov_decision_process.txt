Enterprise portfolio analysis using finite state Markov decision process . This invention introduces a method, system and computer readable media that enables a computer system or computer networked system to perform enterprise portfolio transition optimization. The invention considers several key factors that are traditionally treated informally. The invention provides a sequential decision model for enterprise portfolio transition management of computer and software resources. Using a finite state Markov Decision process, a mathematical formulation is developed to ensure an optimal enterprise portfolio transition plan, with the objective of balancing expected value and risk, that is solved numerically via an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. The output of the model is a set of recommendations in the form of a transition plan for each of the computer and software resources selected within the enterprise portfolio during each phase of a planning horizon.
