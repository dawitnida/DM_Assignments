Systems and methods for trading at a price within a spread market . A system and method is provided to allow traders to submit midprice orders to trade at a price within a spread of a market, preferably at the midpoint of a spread market, while maintaining anonymity of the midprice order. A midprice order is anonymous because other traders do not know whether the submitted midprice orders are orders to buy or orders to sell. A midprice order may remain active until it is traded with a contra midprice order or until a parameter associated with the order is breached, thereby resulting in cancellation of the midprice order.
