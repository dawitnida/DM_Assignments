Universal payment activator using the mobile telephone network . Starting from a purchase system wherein the holder of a mobile phone comes to an agreement with a financial company which provides him with a paycard to which he can subsequently charge his purchases, in such a manner that in each purchase he should provide his telephone number so that they may validate the operation in a processing centre contacting the user by phone to ask for the payment authorisation after identification of the user by a secret code, the invention consists of using a new card (1), with the classic sixteen digits, where the first four (2) correspond to the specific BIN of the processing company, the nine following ones (3) to the user's mobile phone number and the last digit (4) consists of a control digit for the 15 previous ones, as in any conventional paycard. In this manner, on supplying the client physically with the card, or its data through Internet, the mobile phone number is inadvertently being supplied to be able to validate the operation by telephone.
