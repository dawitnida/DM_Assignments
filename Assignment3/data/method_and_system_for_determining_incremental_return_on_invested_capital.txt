Method and system for determining incremental return on invested capital . Incremental return on invested capital is determined by dividing the change in net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by the change in invested capital (IC). NOPAT is net income, plus amortization, plus net interest on debt, plus net after-tax charges. IC is adjusted book value of equity, plus pooling premiums, plus cumulative goodwill, plus cumulative net after-tax charges. Trends for future incremental return on invested capital are estimated from price earnings (P/E) ratios, with the estimates of incremental return on invested capital generally one or two years forward from the P/E.
