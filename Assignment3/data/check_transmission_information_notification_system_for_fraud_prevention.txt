CHECK TRANSMISSION INFORMATION NOTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR FRAUD PREVENTION . A fraud detection system can be implemented by a check processor and a financial institution. The check processor can notify the financial institution proximate to the time a check is submitted to a merchant. The financial institution can then assess whether the check is suspicious and, if suspicious, contact the account holder to confirm that the account holder actually wrote the check. The financial institution can make direct contact with the account holder to confirm that the account holder is aware of the check writing activity.
