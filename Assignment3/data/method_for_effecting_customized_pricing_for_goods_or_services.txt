Method for effecting customized pricing for goods or services . A method for pricing products (e.g., goods or services) offered to a customer comprises the steps of modeling customer behavior using a Zero Inflated Regression Model approach, using records of buyer responses to past offers, to yield an expected demand for the goods or services as a function of price; calculating the seller performance goal as a function of price using the expected customer demand; and selecting the price proposal to maximize the seller performance goal. The Zero Inflated Model is used to calculate the likelihood that the customer may have a non-zero demand for the product or service as a function of price. The Non-Negative Regression Model is used to calculate the expected demand for the product or service given that the customer may have non-zero demand.
