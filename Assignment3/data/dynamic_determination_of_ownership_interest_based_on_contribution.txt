Dynamic determination of ownership interest based on contribution . A technique is provided for determining ownership interest allocation for a business, wherein transactions of contributors with the business are grouped into contributor transaction classes (CTCs), and a contribution value is calculated for the contributor transactions in each CTC to indicate the contribution of each transaction to the value of the business, using one or more performance metrics for each CTC, and lastly, at least one ownership interest award rule for a contributor is determined, based on the calculated contribution values for the CTCs. The technique can be performed with a digital computer and can provide real-time dynamic measures of ownership interest allocation.
