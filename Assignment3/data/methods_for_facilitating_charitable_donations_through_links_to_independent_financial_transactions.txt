Methods for facilitating charitable donations through links to independent financial transactions . The present invention describes a method for facilitating donations to a charitable organization wherein a financial transaction involving property is linked to a conditional pledge. A fundraising program facilitates the transactions which directly contribute to affiliated charitable organizations. A property seller aligns with the fundraising program to list their property for sale. The seller selects a charitable organization to receive the pledge upon sale of their property. The fundraising program affiliates agent/brokers to sell the listed property. In the preferred method of the present invention, the affiliated agent/broker sells a property listed by the fundraising program to a fundraising program referred buyer. All fees and transactions are regulated through a title company at closing. The title company funds a commission to the agent/broker, a referral fee to the fundraising program, a nominal administrative fee to the fundraising program, and a percentage of the property's sale price to the charitable organization.
