Method and apparatus for facilitating donations . In a system in which donor members transfer items to recipient members without receiving economic remuneration from the recipient members, a preferred Internet method for facilitating a transfer of an item from a donor member to a recipient member includes: receiving information from each recipient member sufficient to classify each recipient member within predefined classes; receiving from a donor member information for a particular item to be donated, including a designation of at least one predefined class as an eligible class of recipient members for receiving the particular item; and identifying through a website the particular item to such eligible recipient members. A preferred method further includes receiving from a second donor member a pledge applicable to the transfer of the particular item and identifying the pledge to such eligible recipient members.
