Evaluation of financial aspects of a retirement benefit plan . There is provided a method for facilitating an evaluation of a financial aspect of a retirement benefit plan. The method includes determining a set of incremental values between a lower limit value and an upper limit value of a variable relating to the retirement benefit plan, calculating a liability value for each member of the set of incremental values, thus yielding a set of liability values, and storing the set of liability values. The set of liability values is made accessible to an analyzer that receives a hypothetical value for the variable and, based on the hypothetical value, uses a member of the set of liability values to determine a hypothetical liability for the retirement benefit plan.
