Actively managed credit linked note program . A financial investment product that allows an investor to take leveraged exposure to a customized, dynamic pool of credits and earn an enhanced yield. The product consists of a special purpose vehicle, such as a trust, containing one or more underlying assets and a portfolio of diversified credit default swaps. The notional of the outstanding portfolio of default swaps is a multiple of the notional of securities issued by the trust, which creates the leverage. The leverage is non-recourse to the investor and can be either increased or decreased during the life of the trade.
