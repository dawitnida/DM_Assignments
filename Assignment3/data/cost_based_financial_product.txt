Cost-based financial product . In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a cost-based financial product is provided. The cost-based financial product is created at a front end that differentiates at the access level, thereby providing two distinct products--one evolving from direct arbitrage; the other an indigenous copy--that are essentially the same that can flow separately into different service entities. A fixed yield or amount of supply of a first component is divided into a variable yield of a second component that represents the cost basis relationship sought, thereby creating a partial supply devisor quotient scale--a new scale of cost unit change that becomes the new price array on the front end. A front-end application ladder can be created by substituting a price per divisor supply (whether shares of stock, bushels of grain, etc.) quotient scale for the matrix price array of the cost component to accept the expanding or contracting value of the gross changes of the cost product value. Each trade price increment allowing buying or selling of those differentials as they occur in the mimicked cost product ladder or the indigenous one. The cost-based financial product of the present invention enables an indigenous marketplace where traders can make a directly offsetting trade at any of the trade prices, thereby bypassing the arbitrage base by choosing to use the indigenous one.
