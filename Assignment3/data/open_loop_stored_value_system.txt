Open loop stored value system . According to the invention, a payment system for open loop stored benefit products is disclosed. The payment system includes a web-accessible platform, a web interface, a credit processing system, and a translation system. The web-accessible platform is available to a payor for purchase of a stored value account for use by a payee. The web-accessible platform communicates with a first application interface. The stored benefit account is backed by an account issuer and is accepted by a network of unrelated merchants who accept payments from the account issuer. The web interface allows the payor and/or the payee to interact with the web-accessible platform. The credit processing system communicates with a second application interface. The translation system translates between the first application interface and the second application interface.
