METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MONITORING SECURE APPLET EVENTS DURING CONTACTLESS RFID/NFC COMMUNICATION . A system (211) and method (400) for reliable monitoring of secure applet events is provided. The system can include a Near Field Communication (NFC) modem (140) for communicating transaction events, a secure controller (200) for monitoring state transitions caused by the transaction events, and a mobile host (125) for receiving event notifications of the state transitions via an Applications Programming Interface. An NFC reader can send a Transaction Acknowledgement TACK (403) to the NFC modem to confirm a receipt of data associated with an applet event. An INFO message (405) can be included with the TACK for informing a user of secure contactless transaction status through a user interface (190) of the mobile host.
