Method and system for specialized financial management . System and method for augmenting standard financial services products (e.g., bank accounts) for specialized needs such as for children. This involves augmenting existing types of financial services accounts and adding new types of accounts not now offered by financial institutions such as banks. For instance in the present system, a parent can allow a child to access his actual bank account via the parent's actual bank account to support transactions between the parent and child such as paying an allowance, cash withdrawals and deposits, and paying additional interest on the child's account.
