Centralised stochastic simulation process . A method of simulating a local system which is in interaction with other local systems within a global environment. The method includes generating, at a central location, a collection of global sets of values, each representing a possible future global state of the global environment at a future time, and the collection representing a variety of possible future global states. The method also includes transmitting the collection of global sets of values to the local systems. The local systems receive some of the collection, select a local set of parameters, and perform calculations on that data. The collection of values is used as a predictive simulation of the local system.
