Investment grade Shari'ah (Islamic)compliant consumer financial product . A financial instrument in accordance with the principles of the present invention promotes consumer investment using a consistently formatted investment unit, which fosters the development of a secondary market for those investment units thus affording certain investment liquidity to the consumer. Specifically, the present invention creates a standardized platform for the operation of a consumer-oriented Shari'ah compliant security in support of certain depository account functions that are themselves Shari'ah compliant, but more in keeping with conventional economic or banking norms such that passive to semi-passive consumer deposits originating form the Muslim market sector may be cultivated and promoted within banks and like financial institutions. A financial instrument formulated in accordance with the principles of the present invention provides for the creation of a far more manageable and efficient consumer-based Islamic investment account function than present practices permit. Further, a networked application of the present invention can overcome significant logistical considerations to appointing and designating a SSB for on-going matters of Shari'ah compliance and supervision.
