Method for investment management . "A method of investment management of the present invention creates the new logic and the new market mechanism of capital by incorporating the basic principle of capitalism into a venture business. It provides a third financial intermediary function ""structured finance"" with a novel concept of an indirect investment responsible for the supply of funds to the industrial world. Profit growth increases two or five-fold if the fund investments are turned over 2 to 5 times, resulting only in the accumulated increase in the number of invested target companies and the amount of investments. Thus, both an investment principal risk and a reinvestment risk can be decreased without limit. The present invention provides a novel mechanism that allows an asset securitization for circulating funds to cope against both reluctance of a bank to lend funds and unliquidation of investment capital and assets, so that the earning capacity can be strengthened."
