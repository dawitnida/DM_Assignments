DESKTOP ALERT WITH INTERACTIVE BONA FIDE DISPUTE INITIATION THROUGH CHAT SESSION FACILITATED BY DESKTOP APPLICATION . A consumer installs a desktop application on a computer which renders a user interface on the computer's desktop. Upon installation, the desktop application is registered to receive offers and alerts. Each alert includes data for a transaction on an account conducted with a merchant where the account was issued by an issuer to an account holder to conduct transactions on the account with merchants. A received alert is rendered on the desktop. If the consumer, upon review of the rendered alert, deems the corresponding transaction to be fraudulent, the consumer can operate the user interface to activate a live chat with a web service, and use the live chat to send information sufficient to initiate a bona fide dispute of the transaction. The offers are rendered on the user interface as advertisement and are selectable to initiate a transaction on the account.
