Geneticically engineered business and management structure . This invention relates to methods of doing business whereby subordinate business entities are structured under a parent controlling entity. Subordinate entities are capable of genetically propagating; a subordinate corporate entity and its propagates is termed a pod. A top-down management system is enacted, through feed-back loops from the genetic propagates of the subordinate entity. Through this feed-back loop, the entire structure of the parent business entity and its subordinate pod changes simultaneously in response to changes in business environment, sales figures, or other constraints selected for measurement. Subordinate corporate entities may be entirely different businesses as the parent corporate entity. The parent corporate entity always acts as manager, through an operating agreement, under which the subordinate corporate entities are organized. Subordinate corporate entities are always separate corporations, organized with separate corporate charters from the parent corporate entity.
