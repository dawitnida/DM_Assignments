SOFTWARE SYSTEM FOR FACILITATING USER CREATION OF A LIFE TRUST . A software-implemented system and method are disclosed for enabling user creation of an irrevocable life trust for a child with little or no help from an attorney. The method includes promotion of life trusts, and of the possibility of self-created and self-administered life trusts. The user completes a software-presented template, which is used to provide documents that can be executed to establish a life trust. The software focuses exclusively on life trust creation, thereby minimizing its cost and complexity. In preferred embodiments, administration of the life trust is aided by supporting materials, thereby avoiding long-term software support and upgrade costs. Some embodiments enable a user to invest life trust funds in a tax-deferred annuity without losing the annuity's tax-deferred status. Preferred embodiments include software usage limiting features, such as password protection, watermarks, background shading and other duplication inhibiting features, as well as local and/or remote tracking of template usage.
