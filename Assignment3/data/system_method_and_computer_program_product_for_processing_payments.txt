SYSTEM, METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR PROCESSING PAYMENTS . Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to systems, methods, and computer program products for verifying payment data related to payments sent from a payor to a biller and/or accelerating posting of such payments. More particularly, a system is provided for receiving payment data related to a payment sent from a payor to a biller and for verifying the accuracy of the payment data before allowing the biller to accept the payment. The system is configured to verify the accuracy of the payment data by comparing at least a portion of the payment data to the biller's substantially real-time account records. The system is then configured to allow the biller to accept payments that include accurate data and to identify those payments that do not include accurate data. The system may further be configured to provide the source of the payment data with an indication that the payment data is inaccurate.
