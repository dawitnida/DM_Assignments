Computer-implemented method of reducing risk in a payment-based transaction wherein payment is made from an account holder to a counterparty using a payment bank system employing a risk filter routine that determines whether to selectively reject payment based upon at least one user-supplied risk parameter including a clean payment limit . A real-time, global system and method for controlling payments risk, liquidity risk and systemic risk arising between financial counterparties active in payments-based transactions. The system comprises: a plurality of User Host Applications for use by plurality of Users; a plurality of Third Party Host Applications for use by plurality of Third Parties; and a plurality of Payment Bank Host Applications for use by a plurality of Payment Banks operating a plurality of domestic payment systems. All host applications communicate via cryptographically secure sessions via private communications networks and/or the Internet global computer network. User and Payment Bank access is secured by digital certification. Each Payment Bank Host Application has a mechanism for processing payment messages, including payments instructions to be carried out in its domestic payments system on behalf of a plurality of account holders (including bank correspondents). In addition, each Payment Bank Host Application includes a filter process module for processing payments instructions, prior to being carried out by the domestic payment system. In the event of a counterparty payment failure or insolvency, the Filter Process Module enables instantaneous, automated suspension of all further payments to the counterparty in a multiplicity of chosen currencies. The reduction in payments risk and liquidity risk to predetermined tolerances reduces the likelihood of contingent defaults in the event of payment failure due to bank insolvency or other unforeseen event, and thereby reduces systemic risk to the global financial system.
