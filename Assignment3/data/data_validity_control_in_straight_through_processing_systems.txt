Data validity control in straight-through processing systems . A data processing apparatus, a device and a corresponding method for use in a straight-through processing system are provided. In the apparatus, a data storage unit has data fields for storing a plurality of pairs of first and second data items. Each second data item includes validation information relating to the associated first data item of the respective pair. The validation information indicates at least one of a plurality of distinct validation levels. The apparatus further has a controller for assigning initial validation levels to second data items and updating assigned validation levels, and a first data interface unit for interfacing to at least one external device. The controller is arranged for sending at least one first data item stored in the data storage unit to an external device, and determining an updated validation level from feedback information received from a validity-relevant process performed by the external device.
