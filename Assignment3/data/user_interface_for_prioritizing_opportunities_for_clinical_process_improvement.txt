User Interface for Prioritizing Opportunities for Clinical Process Improvement . Methods and user interfaces are provided for prioritizing opportunities for optimizing clinical processes within clinical facilities. An optimized practice process model may be defined for a particular clinical procedure, setting forth an optimal clinical process. In addition, critical levers may be identified within the optimal clinical process, representing the activities that have the greatest impact on outcomes. Clinical facilities may collect current measures for the critical levers, and the current measures may be compared against an optimal, benchmark, and/or target measure. Based on the comparison, opportunities for clinical process optimization may be identified. User interfaces are provided for prioritizing the opportunities, for example, based on benefit indexes and effort indexes determined for each opportunity.
