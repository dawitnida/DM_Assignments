Accrual and validation system, and associated methods . Systems and processes are disclosed for validating and processing invoices for labor, service contracts, equipment and/or other resources against data representing actual expenditures and expectations set forth by project management systems and software. An accrual and validation database identifies duplicate invoices, erroneous contractor rates and/or erroneous contractor hours by identifying and reporting variances, accrued costs and other information. A project management database associates approved work with sponsoring budget centers so that general ledger transactions may be generated to allocate approved invoice charges. Among other functions, the database may be configured to (a) retrieve project description and actual costing information from project management systems and convert that information into records setting forth per-project, per-day, per-contractor records, (b) validate that a contractor performed work within authorized periods by cross-checking invoices with project schedules and projections, (c) provide reports and analyses per project management requests and/or (d) generate automated transactions to an electronic payment system.
