METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MONITORING FOR AND REPORTING OF LIEN DISTRESS EVENTS . A computer-based method of monitoring for and reporting of a lien distress event relatable to a lien against a property includes the steps of extracting loan data from a client loan portfolio, defining the lien distress event relatable to the loan data by using one or more lien distress event criterion, detecting an occurrence of the lien distress event iteratively, and notifying a client of the occurrence of the lien distress event.
