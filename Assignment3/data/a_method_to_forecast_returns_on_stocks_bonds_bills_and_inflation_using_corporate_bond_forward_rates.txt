A Method to Forecast Returns on Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Using Corporate Bond Forward Rates . This invention modifies the Ibbotson-Sinquefield model to use current corporate bond yields as the principal input for forecasting returns on stocks, bonds, treasury bills, and inflation rates. This allows increasing the forecast period to the maximum time horizon using corporate bond yields, which currently is up to 100 years.
