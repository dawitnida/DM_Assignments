Methods and apparatus for performing task management based on user context . Task management techniques based on user context are provided. More particularly, techniques are presented for calculating task attribute values based on user context data. Once task attributes of a user have been determined, the tasks can be prioritized and a suggestion can be made to the user to perform the tasks in the given order. In a first aspect of the invention, a computer-based technique for scheduling at least one task associated with at least one user includes obtaining context associated with the at least one user, and automatically determining a schedule for the at least one user to perform the at least one task based on at least a portion of the obtained context and based on one or more task attributes associated with the at least one task.
