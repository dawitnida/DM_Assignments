System for Cash, Expense And Withdrawal Allocation Across Assets and Liabilities to Maximize Net Worth Over a Specified Period . This invention constitutes a method for taking a set of input parameters specifying a person or family's assets, liabilities, income and expenses and computing the optimal amount of cash to withdrawal from each credit source or asset (including liquidation of physical assets, credit card balance transfers, and use of loan sources) and the allocation of expenses and cash flow across assets and liabilities so as to maximize net worth by a particular date. The method consists of computing marginal and average expense and return functions for each asset and liability to do a no-withdrawal monthly optimization from the start month to the target month on which to maximize net worth, then recursively computing optimal withdrawal amounts for each source of capital on specific months, ultimately finding the optimal withdrawal amount for each source on each of these months and returning the optimal allocation of expenses and the resulting income and cash-flow across assets and liabilities. This invention is being applied to an online environment, where the user inputs the necessary details and optimization takes place on the server.
