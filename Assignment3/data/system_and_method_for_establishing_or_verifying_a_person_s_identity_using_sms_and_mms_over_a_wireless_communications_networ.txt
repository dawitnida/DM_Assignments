System and method for establishing or verifying a person's identity using SMS and MMS over a wireless communications network . "Individuals asked to present two forms of picture identification face a problem as individuals usually only have one form of picture ID, that form of identification generally being a state-issued driver's license. The disclosed invention is a system and method for a party, generally a Customer or Patron, to establish proof of identification to another party, generally a Merchant or Agent, via a mobile phone using the mobile communications networks. The invention thereby provides the Merchant or Agent with an additional capability to verify the identity of Customers, including verification of the date of birth of the Customer. In a preferred embodiment, the invention uses the Short Message Service (""SMS"") and Multimedia Messaging Service (""MMS"") features available on mobile phones, or other wireless communication devices, to establish the identity of a Customer after communicating a request for such identification to a government administered identification database system."
