Event-driven financial analysis interface and system . A system for graphically displaying financial markets event data to a user includes a computer, one or more databases remote from the computer, a communications link configured to permit the computer to access the databases and a user interface having a display device coupled to the computer configured to display information about a selected security, securities or related scenario on a single display screen. The information displayed further includes a time series representing past historical data for the security over a selectable period of time, a first group of catalysts mapped in parallel with the time series of the past historical data corresponding to the security and a second group of catalysts mapped to future data corresponding to the security. Each catalyst is represented by an icon. The icon has one or more attributes that provide direct visual information to the user if the data density is less than a predetermined value, but only indicates an existence of the catalyst and a time frame of the catalyst if the data density is greater than the predetermined value.
