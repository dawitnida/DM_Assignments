METHOD OF PRINTED BILL PAYMENT USING OPTICALLY IMAGING PEN . A method of enabling payment of bills using an optically imaging pen is provided in which a coded tag printed on a bill is optically imaged with an image sensor of the pen, the position of the pen nib relative to the bill during the imaging is computed in the pen, and indicating data is generating in the pen and transmitted thereby to a computer system to enable bill payment. The bill has information on a requested payment and the coded tags. Each tag encodes the bill's identity and it's printed location. The nib position is computed from the tag location identified in the imaged tag, an observed perspective distortion on the imaged tag, and a known spatial relationship between the pen's physical axis containing the nib and the pen's optical axis containing the image sensor. The indicating data is indicative of the bill's identity and the computed nib position.
