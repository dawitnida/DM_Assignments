Route Planning and Commodity Cost Estimating System . The present invention is a travel planning system including a commodity cost forecasting component and a route planning component that can be utilized in conjunction with one another to provide a commodity cost optimized route between locations supplied by a user of the system. The commodity cost forecasting component utilizes a suitable algorithm and current commodity cost information to provide an estimate of commodity costs at locations along an optimized route provided by the route planning component to travel between the point of origin and the destination supplied by the user to the system. The system also enables a user to determine the estimated commodity cost at a selected location, separately from planning a travel route to or from that location.
