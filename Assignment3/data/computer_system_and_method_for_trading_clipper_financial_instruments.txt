Computer System and Method for Trading Clipper Financial Instruments . "A computer and data-processing system and method for specifying, trading, and clearing Clipper financial instruments. A Clipper is a new, ""all-in"" margined derivative that can be applied to almost any referenced Underlying financial instrument. A Clipper's value at expiration is calculated by first subtracting the negotiated face-value price for an Underlying as of the time of inception of the trade, from the observed face-value price of that same Underlying at the time of expiration, and then capping that difference to a maximum specified amount of gain or loss, called a ""clip limit."" A ""clip limit"" is specified by the two counterparties at the time of inception of the trade. Such a ""clip limit"" dually serves as the ""all-in"" margin that could be required from the two counterparties from a clearinghouse to guarantee any profit or loss outcome of the trade. The maximum positive or negative value of the Clipper can be settled by such a clearinghouse on a cash or cash equivalent payment basis, fully funded from the ""all-in"" margin of the losing counterparty."
