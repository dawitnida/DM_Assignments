Methods for performing data processing operations associated with securities and security structures . One embodiment of the present invention relates to a computer implementable method for performing data processing operations associated with a security issued by an issuer, which method comprises the steps of: coupling a debt of the issuer and a warrant; structuring the warrant with the requirement to purchase a fixed number of shares of stock of the issuer; allocating proceeds from issuance of the security essentially entirely to the debt and storing data representative of the allocated proceeds; and tracking a payment status of a plurality of installment payments due on the warrant and storing data representative of the payment status so that the installment payments may be applied to the warrant; wherein each of the installment payments is distinct from the proceeds associated with the issuance of the security. Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a security issued by an issuer, comprising: a debt of the issuer; and a warrant, which warrant has associated therewith a right to purchase a fixed number of shares of stock of the issuer; wherein proceeds from issuance of the security are allocated essentially entirely to the debt; and wherein the warrant is paid for by at least one payment distinct from the proceeds associated with the issuance of the security.
