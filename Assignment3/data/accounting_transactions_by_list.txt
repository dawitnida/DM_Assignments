Accounting transactions by list . A method and system are provided for processing multiple related financial transactions in a computer-based financial accounting system. A user interface is provided to receive the information corresponding to the multiple related financial transactions. If desired, any of a common transaction type, date and amount can be specified. The user can select information for the related financial transactions from a list or from a set of business rules, and can then apply the information. This causes a separate transaction to be automatically generated and optionally stored for each party. Sales tax transactions can be automatically determined for each of the multiple related financial transactions. Once the multiple related financial transactions have been generated and stored, they can be displayed in a check register format that can allow editing the transactions. Some or all of the multiple related financial transactions can be assigned to a group so that subsequent operations can be expedited. For example, a group can be selected, and a specified change can be applied to all transactions of the group. Also, if one transaction of a group is edited, the other transactions of the group can automatically be likewise edited.
