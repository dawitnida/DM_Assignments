Identity can be verified by biometric analysis (e.g., finger/thumb print scan), username and password, optical feature scan, or a combination thereof or of like mechanisms, for instance. Accordingly, the claimed subject matter provides a mechanism to verify identification of a user of an MCD and incorporate user ID into remote data exchange, including remote financial transactions, with one or more networked devices.
