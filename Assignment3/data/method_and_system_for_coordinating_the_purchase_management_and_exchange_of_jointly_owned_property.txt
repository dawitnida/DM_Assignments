Method and system for coordinating the purchase, management, and exchange of jointly owned property . The present invention features a computer-assisted method for finding or locating real property and for coordinating and administering the purchase, management, and exchange of such property within an identified community of participants. The system and business method is a combination of incentivizing real estate agent marketing support, the proprietary development of an electronic database storing and exploiting both real property and client information, a risk-mitigated purchase plan, and the implementation of coordinated, shared property use through customized covenants mutually adopted by property owners. The system is a shared equity/ownership system, with the properties preferably being high-end properties.
