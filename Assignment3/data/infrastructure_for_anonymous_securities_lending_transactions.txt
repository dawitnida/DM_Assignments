Infrastructure for anonymous securities lending transactions . A stock loan contract is anonymously formed through a software program and sent to a central clearing party that performs a novation in which first and second contracts are substituted for the stock loan contract, the first contract being between the borrower and the central clearing party, the second contract being between the lender and the central clearing party. The central clearing party guarantees the delivery of the stock and the cash for the stock loan contract, so the parties for the contract can be anonymous to each other. The software program may provide price discovery via a batch auction, in which the software program determines an equilibrium price for the batch auction, the equilibrium price being selected to maximize the number of shares loaned in the auction. A list of orders available for loan formation is available to a user of the software program prior to the occurrence of the batch auction, and one of these orders can be selected by the user for formation of a stock loan prior to the batch auction. Alternatively, the price discovery can occur in negotiated trading occurring entirely by structured messages having values for predefined fields and associated terms selected from a predefined set of terms.
