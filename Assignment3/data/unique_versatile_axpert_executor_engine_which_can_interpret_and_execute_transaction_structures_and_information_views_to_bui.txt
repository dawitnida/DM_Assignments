UNIQUE VERSATILE AXPERT EXECUTOR ENGINE WHICH CAN INTERPRET AND EXECUTE TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AND INFORMATION VIEWS TO BUILD INFORMATION SYSTEMS . "A technology platform which facilitates the business and domain users to build real time enterprise applications like SCM, CRM, and ERP etc without any knowledge of coding. It saves all business rules, access-control mechanism, business logic, related parts and otherwise middle-tier of any application as metadata within a database. Enterprise applications are built by doing high level definitions and not by writing software programs, the application is defined as process structures that are stored in XML format in the database. It stores the Business logic in the database as ""Process Structures"" thereby making the application server redundant. The process structures are then read and rendered by the Structure Execution and Management (STEM) which consists of execution services and management services. It can interpret and execute transaction structures and information views. This makes information system building simple and quick. The technology reduces a developer's job to a great extent because it only requires elementary knowledge of SQL."
