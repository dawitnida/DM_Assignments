Method for improving financial transaction security . Methods are disclosed for performing cardholder verification associated with a customer card transaction through use of code sequences delivered independently to a point of sale terminal and to a customer unit (e.g., mobile phone). A point of sale terminal initiates a customer card transaction by sending a card number to a customer card processing system. An application server receives the card number and generates a code sequence corresponding to the transaction. The application server sends a first instance of the code sequence to the point of sale terminal and a second instance of the code sequence to the customer unit associated with the card number. Authorization status of the transaction is thereafter determined by an operator of the point of sale terminal comparing the first and second instances of the code sequence.
