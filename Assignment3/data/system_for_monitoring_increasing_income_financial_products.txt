System for monitoring increasing income financial products . The increasing income financial product is a financial contractual product or program wherein a subscriber invests and designates primary and secondary beneficiaries. Investment plans include (a) lump sum (b) periodic (c) a pledge of an asset, or (d) combinatory. The primary beneficiary is assigned to a group of similar beneficiaries and to a certain contract group. With pledges, when the primary dies, the pledged assets are gathered by an administrator. Income is paid according to the contract to surviving primaries on an increasing, survivorship basis until (a) all primaries die; or (b) a predetermined percentage die; (c) the contract expires per its parameters; or (d) upon any other contractually defined event. Alternatively, the increasing income may be paid to the surviving members based upon mortality tables. Upon expiration, the surviving primaries or designated secondaries receive pro rata shares of the principal from the contract group. A self-directed financial investment feature enables the subscriber/primary beneficiary to direct investments.
