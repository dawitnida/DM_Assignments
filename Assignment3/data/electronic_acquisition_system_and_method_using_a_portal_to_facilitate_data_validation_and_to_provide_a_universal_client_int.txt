Electronic acquisition system and method using a portal to facilitate data validation and to provide a universal client interface . A system and method providing a centralized acquisition system for facilitating event requests for multiple client products and/or services. The acquisition system includes at least one of a portal and a client interface system for accepting data from a client and an E-Acquisition system for facilitating product or service fulfillment for the client. The E-Acquisition system includes a handler system for facilitating the event request from the client and a worker utility invoked by the handler system to perform tasks associated with the event request. A dispatcher forwards event requests to one or more handlers to apply client business logic to process and fulfill the event request. The handlers further employ task-specific workers for facilitating the individual steps required to complete the process. One worker facilitates global data validation for multiple clients, which simplifies validation, decisioning, and fulfillment of event requests for the multiple clients.
