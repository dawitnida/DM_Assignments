Methods and apparatus for processing check transactions in self service customer checkout terminals . Systems and techniques for managing check payments in self service transactions are described. A self service terminal accepts inputs from a customer to conduct a transaction and, upon an appropriate selection from a customer, accepts a check from the customer in settlement of the transaction. The terminal reads magnetically encoded information from the check, captures an image of the check and prepares a check record including the check information, transaction amount and check image. The terminal transmits the check record to a cashier at a remote cashier station. The cashier may use the check record, including the check image, to determine whether to approve or disapprove the transaction.
