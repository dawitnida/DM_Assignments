"Unfilled prescriptions are submitted to a registry comprising pre-qualified pharmacies for a ""reverse auction"" in which the pharmacies bid for the opportunity to fill the prescription. The pharmacies are allowed to bid based on price and/or offering ancillary services. The auction may also be used to bid on supplying specified pharmaceutical cognitive services. The method may also include obtaining cost comparisons with generic substitutes or similar alternative pharmaceutical products. The system may further comprise automatically requesting a review by the prescriber for a list of similar substitutes or prior-authorization for third-party payers. The winner of the reverse auction is selected by the customer."
