Multiple pricing in a lottery based on variable ratios . A method of multiple pricing for a predetermined or progressive single jackpot in a single lottery game is disclosed. For instance, a lottery ticket purchased for one dollar can result in a ten million dollar win, a lottery ticket purchased for two dollars can result in a twenty million dollar win, a lottery ticket purchased for three dollars can result in a thirty million dollar win, etc. Further, different winnings increments can be used. For instance, the three-dollar ticket can result in a forty million dollar win to induce the purchase of higher-priced tickets. The potential distributions can be established according to a constant ratio, a variable ratio, or a combination of a constant ratio and a variable ratio. In addition, the lottery prize can also be a variable prize that progressively increases with a percentage of each ticket sold. The prizes are won from a single pool.
