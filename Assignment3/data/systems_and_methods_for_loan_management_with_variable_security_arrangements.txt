A data processing system, program product, and method is provided for managing at least one credit-granting account of a participant. The system comprises in one embodiment an electronic database including information describing collateral assets of the participant used for securing the credit-granting account, and a computer system comprising one or more processors coupled to the electronic database and programmed among them to establish through an API a credit-granting account with a facility to maintain a plurality of collateral assets as collateral for the credit-granting account; receive new information regarding a collateral asset that is real estate for securing the credit-granting account; determine perfection status of a security interest in the collateral asset; store, in the electronic database, the new information and at least any change in the perfection status; and determine an interest rate to be charged on outstanding credit balances based on the new information regarding the collateral asset available for securing the credit-granting account containing the perfection status. The system further comprises an electronic network access device for sending a signal identifying the new interest rate to an access-vehicle issuing system so that the issuing system can charge the interest rate on outstanding credit balances.
