SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ASCERTAINING THE LEGAL DISTRIBUTION OF INTESTATE PROPERTY . This invention generally relates to a system and method for ascertaining the legal distribution of an individual's intestate property through the use of variables created to define single points of data which are described by the appropriate body of laws as being necessary to the determination of the said legal distribution. This invention solicits and collects a minimum quantity of said data through the use of a hierarchical arrangement of the created variables, which hierarchical arrangement is ordered upon the basis of priority each variable has in relation to all remaining variables which are required by the appropriate body of laws. A report is creating and delivered to a user which details the legal distribution of the subject intestate property represented as the dollar value associated with each respective legal recipient.
