Investment vehicle, system and method . Investment vehicles, systems and methods provide for the investment of funds in an investment opportunity selected based on criteria to reduce risk and increase or maximize return. In one embodiment, the risk is reduced by selecting an investment opportunity for investment after the initial public offering (IPO) of the investment opportunity only if the investment opportunity included pre-IPO private-equity funding. Further, if the pre-IPO private-equity funding included venture funding, selection of the investment opportunity for investing requires that certain revenue or profitability criteria be satisfied.
