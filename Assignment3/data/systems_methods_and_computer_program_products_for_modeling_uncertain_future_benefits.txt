Systems, methods and computer program products for modeling uncertain future benefits . Systems, methods and computer program products are provided for modeling future benefits. According to the method, modeling future benefits begins by defining a growth rate for the good for each time segment of a period of time, where the period of time includes a plurality of time segments. An uncertainty for the good is then determined for each time segment. Next, a benefit distribution is determined at an end of each time segment based upon the growth rate and uncertainty for the respective time segment. Finally, a benefit value is selected at the end of each time segment by randomly selecting each benefit value based upon a respective benefit distribution to thereby model future benefits over the period of time. The method therefore allows the growth rate and/or the uncertainty to very between time segments. The method can also account for contingencies at the end of previous time segments.
