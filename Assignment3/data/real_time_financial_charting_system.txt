Real-time financial charting system . "A real-time financial charting system (10) is described that allows real-time stock market pricing information to be viewed through a browser-only interface on the desktops of Internet users. Historical intraday data (18) and new transaction data (22) ""pushed"" from a server (12) over the World wide Web are combined and saved as transaction data (20) locally by the client's charting module (16). The computer software charting module on the client computer plots a graph (600) of the real-time financial data. The graph is displayed on the client's computer screen so that the user is able to readily observe changes in the real-time financial data substantially as they occur in a dynamic charting format The system employs HTTP tunnelling that makes it substantially immune to firewalls."
