TRANSACTION CONTROL METHODS FOR USE IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND INFORMATION BANKING . A method for conducting a financial transaction involves a person using a mobile device. The mobile device accesses information regarding the proposed financial transaction and determines, based on that information, whether the proposed transaction is permissible according to pre-set preferences associated with the person. Some of these preferences may be controllable by the person, and other preferences may be only partially controllable or not controllable by the person. The proposed transaction is denied if it is determined not to be permissible, and the proposed transaction is allowed if it is determined to be permissible. If the transaction is denied, the person may be presented with the option of changing the preferences, and authentication may be necessary to do so.
