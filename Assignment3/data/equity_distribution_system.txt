Equity Distribution System . The present invention relates to a method of creating, purchasing and selling the equity notes based on the appraised value of a real property. A property owner sells, for a certain consideration, equity note to an investor. The compensation paid may be in the form of cash or an equivalent good or service. The equity note has a value which potentially may appreciate over time but will vary depending upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the value of the property and potential improvements made to the property. The equity note can be sold through securitization or some other method. The option can also become a traded commodity and form the basis for a real estate options and futures market.
