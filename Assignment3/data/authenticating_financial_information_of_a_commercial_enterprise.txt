Authenticating Financial Information of A Commercial Enterprise . Techniques are described for generating an assessment of capital state of the commercial enterprise, which may be referred to as a capital health check. Financial key performance indicators for a commercial enterprise are adjusted. The adjusted financial key performance indicators represent lower credit risk than credit risk reflected by the unadjusted financial key performance indicators. A qualitative scoring model is applied to the adjusted financial key performance indicators to generate an assessment of capital state of the commercial enterprise. Authentication of the assessment of the capital state of the commercial enterprise by a third-party financial representative is enabled.
