INTERLINE REVENUE SHARE OPTIMIZATION METHOD . A carrier's interline revenue share optimization method in which the carrier is involved in several interline multi-segment journeys with other partner carriers. Each of the involved carriers operate at least one segment of the interline multi-segment journeys and each of these journeys is associated with a fare. The interline revenue share optimization method utilizes a computer system and includes the steps of a) receiving and storing in data structured storing elements of the computer system memory, input data that includes a fixed set of tickets including the journey and the associated fare, a fixed set of prorate factors, a fixed set of partner carriers' interline rules, a set of carrier's interline rules, an interline revenue share determining algorithm and an optimization algorithm, b) defining the variables to optimize, c) splitting the fares of the tickets between the carrier and the partner carriers and calculating an objective function as the carrier's interline revenue share, d) optimizing the objective function and obtaining the optimized set of carrier's interline variables by utilizing a processor of the computer system and e) providing via an output device of the computer system the optimized set of carrier's interline variables.
