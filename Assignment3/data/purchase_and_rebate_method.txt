Purchase and rebate method . A purchase and rebate method comprises the steps of facilitating a purchase by a purchaser of a good or service from a seller and allocating a percentage of the purchase price for the benefit of the seller. The purchaser's rights to the amounts so allocated will preferably depend on whether the purchaser is able to accumulate at least a minimum amount of allocated funds, and whether the purchaser may do so within a preferably pre-established period of time. Where the purchaser does not achieve the minimum allocation within the established period of time, the purchaser may preferably obtain a refund of at least a portion of the allocated amount. Where the purchaser achieves the minimum allocation within the established period of time, the allocated amount is preferably placed into a financial instrument. Thereafter, the purchaser may obtain a refund of substantially all of the allocated amount.
