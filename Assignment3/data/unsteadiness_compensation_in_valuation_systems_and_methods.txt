Unsteadiness compensation in valuation systems and methods . There is provided a data processing system and method for valuing a bundle of constructs that may individually fail, in case of a separation event causing the bundle of constructs to separate a failing construct from the bundle. A present value determination unit applies a predefined model to determine a present value of the bundle of constructs after having separated the failing construct from the bundle. Further, a static value determination unit determines a static value by reducing a static base number each time a separation event occurs. Furthermore, a calculation unit calculates a value of the bundle of constructs based on the determined present value and the determined static value. The calculation unit is adapted to calculate a sum of the determined present value and the determined static value. In an embodiment, the bundle of constructs is a basket of credit default swaps.
