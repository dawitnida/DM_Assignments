System and method for basket trades and trade allocation . A system and method where a client creates a basket of intended stock orders, slices the basket into one or more waves of orders, sends trade orders to a broker/dealer for execution, and allocates stocks to one or more client accounts. A backend server receives basket or wave orders, breaks each basket or wave order into individual stock orders, and queues the individual stock orders for submission to an order management system for execution of the order. A market data feed to the client continuously updates the information displayed to the client. The client may strike a basket or wave or individual stock by entering strike information into a client database residing on a client computer. The system also provides for allocation of executed trades to client-specified accounts.
