Distributed peak power tracking solar array power systems and methods . In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, a power system includes a plurality of solar panels in a solar array, with each solar panel configured to receive illumination and produce a panel power output signal for a corresponding power converter. The power converters are configured to produce corresponding converted power output signals as a function of an operating point of the solar panels to provide an array power output signal.
