Method and Processing Arrangement for Providing Various Financing Options . A method is disclosed for determining a repayment amount on a loan that is dependent on an initial value of a property. The method uses input data comprising the initial value of the property, a term for repayment of the loan, a first time for which the repayment amount is to be determined and a current value of the property at the first time. The current value of the property is compared (step 804) with the initial value of the property to determine whether there is a value-based loss or a value-based gain. The method checks (step 802) whether the first time is earlier than the term for repayment. In the event of a prepayment, the repayment amount is determined (step 806) independent of the current value of the property if there is a value-based loss (e.g. using the initial value of the property). The repayment amount is determined (step 808) dependent on the current value of the property if there is a value-based gain.
