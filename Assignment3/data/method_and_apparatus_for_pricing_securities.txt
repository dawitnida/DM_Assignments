Method and apparatus for pricing securities . The invention provides computer-implemented techniques and systems for parsimoniously modelling the price or value, expected rate of return or other relevant characteristics of securities issued by, or referenced to, firms (or other assets) by incorporating risk premia such that a range of different securities can be evaluated within a single, unified and coherent framework, thereby leading to significant reduction in the computing resources otherwise required.
