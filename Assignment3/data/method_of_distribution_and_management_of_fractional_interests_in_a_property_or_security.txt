Method of distribution and management of fractional interests in a property or security . A method for managing the assets of holders of portions of the rights in shares of a property is accomplished by steps of acquiring shares of ownership in a property or a security of a business enterprise. The fractional rights are acquired by an administrator of the fractional rights and of a market maintained for trading the fractional rights. The administrator divides the share of the property or security into portions, such as the right to receive a dividend and the right to receive capital appreciation. A limited duration of time may be established for the fractional right, after which the fractional right may revert to a holder of residual rights. In the market, the administrator may sell rights to investors and is willing to repurchase the rights from the investors.
