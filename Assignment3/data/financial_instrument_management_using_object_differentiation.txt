FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MANAGEMENT USING OBJECT DIFFERENTIATION . Object differentiation used in the context of complex financial instruments and financial instrument management software is described. A computer-implemented method for the management of complex financial instruments using object differentiation is described. A processor may parse a data object stored on a computer-readable storage medium into a plurality of subparts. The data object may represent a single complex financial instrument. An object differentiation key may be retrieved for each of the plurality of subparts. Using at least the retrieved object differentiation keys, a key figure may be generated for each of the plurality of subparts. A list of the plurality of subparts and the generated key figures may be displayed.
