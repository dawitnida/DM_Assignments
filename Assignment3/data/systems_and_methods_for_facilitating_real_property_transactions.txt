Systems and methods for facilitating real property transactions . This patent document discloses systems and methods for generating additional revenue by facilitating real property transfers or the financing of real property. One example method includes facilitating a sale of a real property by securing a reservation of a residual right in the real property. Because of the reservation, a seller may sell the real property to a buyer below a price desired by the seller. Another example method includes providing financing for a real property and securing a reservation of a residual right in the real property. The financing may represent a loan provided to a purchaser or owner of the real property. Because of the reservation, the loan may be provided with a lower interest rate and lower up-front fees. The residual right entitles a party associated with the residual right to receive one or more future payments after the sale or financing for the real property occurs.
