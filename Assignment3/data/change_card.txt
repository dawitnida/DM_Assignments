CHANGE CARD . A transaction card allows for retail purchases involving fractional dollar amounts to be completed without the use of coin currency. Change amounts involving less than one dollar can be either credited to or debited from a monetary value stored on a smart chip in the transaction card by placing the transaction card into a card reader that reads a magnetic swipe strip associated with the smart chip. Amounts credited to the transaction card can be used for secondary transactions not involving paper or coin currency.
