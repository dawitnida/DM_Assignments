Method and apparatus to facilitate competitive financing activities among myriad lenders on behalf of one borrower . A computerized system for negotiating loans on behalf of a borrower collects data on a desired loan transaction in electronic form. Next, the system electronically notifies a plurality of lenders of the requested loan transaction and invites each lender to electronically submit a corresponding quote. The system posts the received quotes to a database that may be viewed by the borrower. The borrower selects quotes from the plurality of quotes, and the system invites the corresponding lenders to participate in a final quote event. In conducting the final quote event, the system displays the selected quotes to the borrower and also displays, to each lender, the lender's current quote and the best terms from among the multiple remaining quotes. Each lender is also provided with options to improve their corresponding quote. After a period of negotiation, the borrower selects one quote from among the multiple quotes as the final quote.
