Apparatus and Method of Collaborative Funding of New Products and/or Services . This invention is a Collaborative Funding Engine (the Engine) that accurately predicts initial demand for and facilitates the funding of design, research, development and/or delivery of products, and/or services (Outputs). The Engine enables one or a plurality of those (the Customers) who desire specific Outputs to combine their resources in Collaborative Funding Pools (CFPs) to fund the Outputs by an Output producer (the Provider) prior to the Output's creation. The Engine includes a Contingent Purchase Order (CPO) system that creates binding obligations on Providers and Customers contingent upon the CFP reaching a specified level (the Hurdle Level) of participation by Customers. The Engine includes an optional Relative Value Bidding feature that can allow each Customer in a CFP to determine its own price for an Output. As a result, different Customers can pay different prices for the same Output depending upon the Output's relative value to the Customer. The collaborative activity of the Engine is stimulated by its Notification Management Module, which informs Providers and Customers of activity within the Engine.
