Portfolio performance tracking . Portfolio performance tracking and reporting includes integration of performance tracking information for previously-sold securities with performance tracking information for securities that are still held in the portfolio. Performance tracking for securities that are still held is performed by comparing the security's current value with the purchase price (basis). Performance tracking for securities that have been sold is performed by comparing the sale price with the purchase price; changes to value that took place subsequent to the sale date are ignored, as they have no bearing on the performance analysis for the portfolio. A report is generated including performance tracking information for individual securities and/or for the portfolio as a whole.
