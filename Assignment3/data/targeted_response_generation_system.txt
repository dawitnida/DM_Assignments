Targeted response generation system . A system for generating a targeted response for investment banking services based on user interest. First, a client corporation and a specific investment banking objective for the client corporation are identified. A web site detailing the corporation and its investment banking objective are then constructed. An e-mail database of potential interested parties, including companies in a similar area to the client corporation, is constructed. The address of the web site is sent to the potential interested parties who then login to the web site. The web site includes a login procedure recording a user profile for each user and issuing the user a password. The user then accesses the web site. The usage statistics of the user for the web site are recorded and analyzed. A targeted response to the user is selected from a variety of responses based on the interests of the user as determined from an interpretation of the usage statistics.
