SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING AND BROKERING FUEL EMISSION OFFSETS . A brokering system and method for providing an incentive for use of more efficient internal combustion engines and hydrogen retrofit kits is disclosed. End users of retrofitted vehicles are provided with discounted fuel costs at authorized fueling stations. The vehicle owner's savings include: a) a reduction in fueling charges because of the vehicle's new reliance on 30% less fossil fuel (which is displaced by hydrogen in the engine), and b) by the purchase of methanol which can be set at a lower cost per calorific equivalent than a barrel of oil while also earning emission offsets to be sold for cash to the end users/creators of carbon credits. In this manner, retrofitted existing internal combustion engines linked to a trust for trading emission offsets will create a consumer-driven hydrogen economy which governments as well as the automotive and petroleum sectors will endorse. Hydrogen, which is substituted for fossil fuel in a retrofitted IC engine result in emission offsets (i.e., the quantum of emissions that are no longer there) which are converted by a regulated emissions trust into cash. This income, which is deposited into the vehicle owner's bank account via the telephone network by using a dedicated hydrogen fueling card and master engine sensor linked to a specific vehicle provided with an engine retrofit kit and an on board source of hydrogen gas. The present method provides a mapping and test kit that relies on OEM engine timing and control sensors to compare engine emissions produced by fossil fuel with emissions eliminated by substituting hydrogen. This method creates consumer demand for cleanly produced sources of hydrogen (beginning with green methanol) to fuel existing OEM engines, which will in turn, induce automobile manufacturers to build more efficient IC engines until, finally, they will all be fueled by 100% hydrogen.
