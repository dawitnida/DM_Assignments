Automated Credit/Debt Management Counsel By Isaiah Bond . The present invention combines automated consulting with live advising within the framework of an online, web-enabled automated credit/debt management counseling and modeling system. An automated coach alerts and focuses the user's attention to the issues to be addressed, and frames decisions to be made with general information on each topic based off of technical calculations in relations to the credit/debt management history analyzed. A live advisor supplies specific, innovative solutions based on the user's unique credit/debt situation as an aid for the results of the computer automated system.
