MONEY TRANSFER USING AN AUTOMATED BANKING MACHINE . Money is transferred from a provider to a requester using automated banking machines. The provider accesses an automated banking machine to identify the requester to whom the money will be transferred and the amount of money to be transfer. The requester is notified of a generated confirmation code. The requester then accesses another automated banking machine to receive the money transfer amount using the confirmation code. After the requester has been verified, the requester selects where the funds are to be transferred.
