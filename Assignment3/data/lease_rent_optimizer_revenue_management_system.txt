Lease rent optimizer revenue management system . The present invention provides a Lease/Rent Optimizer (LRO) for helping property management companies to forecast and analyze market demand and unit availability, as well as to set leasing agreements based on dynamically measured consumer demand. The LRO takes into account customer preferences, market conditions, and competitive behavior. The system optimally applies user-defined business rules to provide market-specific flexibility in combining base rents and concessions to consumers. By forecasting demand for different unit types and lease terms, then using those forecasts to ensure that inventory is optimally positioned to satisfy demand, the LRO is designed to enhance overall revenue contribution from new and renewing leases. Conversely, these features benefit customers by helping them find the unit types and lease terms they need when they need them by better matching rental unit supplies to demand. The LRO provides sophisticated decision support so that property managers can look beyond comparatively static rules of thumb and past experience to set rental rates. Even when management recognizes the need for repricing, the establishing of new prices involves another application of static rules and gut feel that can result in too little or too much change.
