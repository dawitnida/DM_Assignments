Computer process for modeling flow of patients through hospital units . A method of assessing patient flow through a hospital is disclosed. Through the collection of data regarding hospital statistics, a model can be built. Also, an hourly cost can be assigned to each care unit of the hospital for each patient. The model can be used to simulate the flow of patients through the hospital. Additionally, the model can be used to estimate a cost savings that would result from a purchase of patient monitoring equipment, or other resource changes.
