Systems and Methods For Secure Pin-Based Transactions Via a Host Based Pin Pad . A method and system for securely verifying over an open network a transaction using a payment card requiring authorization, such as a PIN, to be used. The system utilizes a secure host system to establish two lines of communication between a merchant and a consumer device used by an individual using the payment card. The secure host system provides a verification interface that is presented to the consumer device, providing a means for the individual to provide verification information. The secure host system receives verification information from the consumer device, couples the verification information with card information supplied by a merchant for verification from a third party payment provider. The transaction service provider verifies the transaction without sending the cardholder's actual PIN over the open network.
