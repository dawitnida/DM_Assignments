HOME EQUITY ESTIMATOR, BANNER PROVIDING INTERACTIVE HOME EQUITY ESTIMATION, AND METHOD FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SAME . An online banner advertisement is provided that enables a consumer to estimate the consumer's home value based on the state where the home is located, the year the home was purchased, and the purchase price. State-level data from Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) can be used to calculate the percentage increase in home value against the purchase price to estimate the current value of the home. An equity calculation can include deducting from the computed current value of the home the purchase price of the home. The calculation can include computing yearly cumulative appreciation value for each year, starting from the year the home was purchase to the present, based on the quarterly appreciation data. Consumers accessing the home equity estimation on the banner are given an option to contact a lender or to proceed to the lender's website where additional information, such as more specific home equity estimation, may be obtained. Consumer access to the banner and/or the home estimation tool available thereon can be monitored. Number of times that consumers access the more specific home equity information pages of the lender website, as well as the number of loan applications being generated as a result of such access can be tracked. Cost and benefits of providing the specific home equity information can be evaluated.
