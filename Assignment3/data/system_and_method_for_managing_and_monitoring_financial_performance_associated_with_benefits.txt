System and method for managing and monitoring financial performance associated with benefits . Data associated with a benefit plan, including enrollment data and claims data, are compared to verify proper payment of claims. Additionally, other information, such as general ledger, employer account information, and employer organizations can be considered. Information can be output to a user, such as a plan administrator, in a form convenient for that user to quickly understand a large amount of information and how that information relates to a business or other entity administering the benefit plan. Various techniques can be used to estimate reserves, and can optionally use a claims lag triangle as input, including a claims lag report method, a earned premium method, and iterative method, and a regression method, for example.
