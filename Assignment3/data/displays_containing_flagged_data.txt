DISPLAYS CONTAINING FLAGGED DATA . Tools to provide visibility into a variety of financial transactions, and in particular aspects, financial transactions involving financial cards, such as debit cards and credit cards. Such tools can allow for authorized users (such as executives of card issuers, and the like) to view information about accounts that meet certain criteria. Merely by way of example, a user can select accounts that have undertaken (or attempted) a certain type of transaction and/or have had a transaction denied (such as a denial for improper PIN, exceeding withdrawal and/or spending limits, etc.) and/or view additional information about those accounts.
