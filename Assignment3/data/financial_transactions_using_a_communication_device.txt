FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS USING A COMMUNICATION DEVICE . A computer implemented system provides a method of conducting a financial transaction. The method begins when the system assigns a designator of a value using a preauthorization by a payor. The system associates the payor with an authorized payor telephone identifier. When the system receives a telephone call with the authorized payor telephone identifier at a specified Direct Inward Dial (DID) telephone number associated with a transaction type, the system responds by sending at least one transaction code to the payor. When the system receives the transaction code from the payee, the designator of value is re-asssigned to from the payor to the payee. The system allows the transaction code to be delivered directly from the payor to the payee or sent automatically to the payee. Each DID telephone number represents different transaction types such as Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), Person-To-Person (P2P), merchant transactions, vending transactions and other types of transactions.
