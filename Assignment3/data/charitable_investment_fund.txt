Charitable investment fund . An investment fund in which a portion of the assessed investment fund fees and/or investment fund service providers' fees are designated for donation to charitable causes as directed by each of the investment fund's shareholders. Shareholders of one or more charitable share classes designate one or more charities to receive the accumulated donation amounts attributable to their individual accounts. Donation amounts are then tracked and paid to charities on a periodic basis according to the designations on the records of the investment fund.
