Method and system for determining an optimum set of measures for the minimization of risks . System and method for determining an optimum set of measures which entails a minimization of risks while observing a predetermined budget (B), wherein, based on coherence components (Z) including possible combinations of measures (MK), each of which comprise a set (M) of measures (m), the associated costs (K) for implementing the set (M) of measures (m) and each of which comprise a utility value (W) for the profit achieved with the implementation of the set (M) of measures (m) to reduce the risks, that joined set (M.sub.opt) of measures (m) is calculated by joining sets (M) of measures from different coherence components (Z) the overall costs (K') of which, calculated by adding the costs of the joined sets (M'), are smaller than the predetermined budget (B), and the overall utility value (W') of which, calculated by adding the utility values (W) of the joined sets (M'), is a maximum, wherein, after a joining of sets (M) of measures (m), a joined set (M') is then screened out if, at a lower overall utility value (W'), it shows higher costs (K') than an already existing set (M) of measures (m).
