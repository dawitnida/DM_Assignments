Systems and methods for modeling credit risks of publicly traded companies . There are provided new structural default models for modeling the likely default of publicly traded companies. In a first embodiment, the invention is straight-forward to implement and allows the capture of some important ingredients of the actual default, including positive short-term CDSs. In a second embodiment them model is somewhat more versatile and complex. Provided is a very efficient method for dealing with the timing of a default boundary, that is, jumps in the company's value, etc. Further provided is a process using Fast Fourier Transform matrix processing for processing the structural default models in a computationally efficient manner.
