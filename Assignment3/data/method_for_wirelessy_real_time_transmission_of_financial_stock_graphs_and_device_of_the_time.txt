Method for wirelessy real-time transmission of financial stock graphs and device of the time . A method for wirelessly real-time transmission of financial stock graphs and device of the same are disclosed, in which, a hyper text transfer protocol transmission servo module (HTTP transmission servo module) is added to a conventional finical quotation terminal. The hyper text transfer protocol transmission servo module is connected to a mobile network through an Ethernet, or a serial communication interface and a modem. The HTTP transmission servo module is further connected to a far-end wireless application protocol gateway (WAP gateway) 6 of a wireless digital system, such as GSM or CDMA for acquiring the service of translating the real-time graph information. The present invention is accessed to a subscriber's device of a mobile phone or a personal digital assistant. The user can remotely control the real-time service of the finical quotation terminal through the operating interface of the wireless mark language (WML) transferred from the hyper text transfer protocol transmission servo module. The user can enter into the HTTP transmission servo module of the finical quotation terminal from a user's premise through a wide area network (Wan) and read the data in a database according to a specific commodity. Then the data is directly translated and compressed into a WBMP graphic file matching with the specification of wireless device bitmap coordinate established by the Wireless Application Protocol Forum. The transmission to the far-end user is performed through the HTTP transmission servo module. Since the graphic file is not optically scanned after printed through a printer, it is not performed in-time and has a lower resolution. In fact, the graphic file is from a real-time market data and then is converted into a digital graphic file and it is directly transferred through a digital protocol, therefore, it is provided in time and has a high resolution.
