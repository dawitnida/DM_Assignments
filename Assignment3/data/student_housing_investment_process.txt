STUDENT HOUSING INVESTMENT PROCESS . A method of investing in a multi-unit residential property used for housing students registered with and attending a academic or quasi-academic institution. The residential property is configured to include common areas and one or more apartments, wherein each apartment further includes common areas and one or more bedroom spaces. Ownership interest in the property is transferred from a first entity to a second entity, and fractional ownership interests in the property are transferred from the second entity to one or more third entities. Factional ownership interest in the property includes occupancy rights to a specific bedroom space. The exclusive ownership interest in the specific bedroom space extends further to include non-exclusive ownership interest with accessibility and usage rights to the common areas associated with the apartment having the specific bedroom space and with the property. Criteria for acquiring, occupying, and/or retaining the fractional ownership interest in the property are established by the second entity.
