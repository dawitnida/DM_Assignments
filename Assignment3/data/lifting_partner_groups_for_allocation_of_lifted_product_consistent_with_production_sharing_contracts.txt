Lifting partner groups for allocation of lifted product consistent with production sharing contracts . An embodiment of the invention regards allocating lifted product volumes to specific entities of a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) through the use of Lifting Partner Groups (LPG) and an Entitlement Percentage (EP), which is itself calculated, consistent with the terms of the PSC. Through this system, specific PSC members no longer need to be identified for each specific terminal lift to allocate the lift back to the PSC entity. Rather, the EP is used in conjunction with the Lifting Product Groups to split up the portion of each lift attributable to each entity for actual accounting purposes, and further to determine the average sales price(s) to be used in calculating total production revenue.
