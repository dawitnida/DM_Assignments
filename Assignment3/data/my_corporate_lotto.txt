MY CORPORATE LOTTO . My Corporate Lotto (MCL) was developed primarily as a lottery game management computer application, designed to maintain, and distribute funds, to members of a syndicate known as shareholders. With MCL, winnings are distributed proportionally to how much each shareholder has invested in the syndicate or group, known as the Corporation. The application may also be used where a monetary, award, banking, or profit sharing program is implemented, where distribution of awards are shared among members of the group based on their level of interest or investment in the corporation.
