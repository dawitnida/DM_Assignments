Adaptive daily spending limits . A computer-implemented system and method are provided for adapting the spending limit of a debit instrument in a networked computer system, particularly a daily spending limit. The method comprises determining or receiving notification of whether an electronic request to approve a debit instrument transaction was declined for exceeding a withdrawl limit or a spending limit, determining transactional risk associated with the debit instrument transaction using computer-implemented criteria, and adapting the spending limit of the debit instrument after the determination of transactional risk. Computer-implemented criteria are used to assess the transactional risk associated with a particular debit instrument transaction.
