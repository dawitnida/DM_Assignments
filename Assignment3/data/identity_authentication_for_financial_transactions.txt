IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION FOR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS . A financial services and transaction network including multiple networked validation stations and remote terminals allows users to access a number of financial services and transactions. A user visiting a remote terminal indicates a desired service or transaction. The user provides any currency or funding information needed for the selected service, after which the remote terminal issues the user a transaction voucher. The user can take this transaction voucher to any of the validation stations in order to authenticate the user's identity and activate the voucher. Once the voucher is activated, the user or a recipient of the voucher can present the voucher at any remote terminal to receive funding or otherwise complete the transaction or service, subject to recipient authentication. The user provides necessary information using the remote terminal or validation station, or supplies the information using the voucher, which is collected upon performance of the requested service or transaction.
