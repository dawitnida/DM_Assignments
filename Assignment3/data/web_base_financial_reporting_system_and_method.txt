Web-base financial reporting system and method . A computer system for facilitating in accessing and reporting detailed financial information from non-depository financial institutions and for enabling comparison of performance of similarly situated non-depository institutions. The system includes a web site and at least one processing component. The web site is used for collecting financial information for predefined periods from the non-depository financial institutions. The processing component processes the information for selected time periods entered into the web site and stores the information in at least one database. The processing information also uses the information entered by all non-depository institutions to determine the status of each non-depository and to generate financial analytical information for internal use within a federally chartered corporation. Thereafter, the processing component uses the information entered by all non-depository institutions to provide a peer report for comparing the performance of similarly situated financial institutions.
