FINANCIAL JOURNALS IN FINANCIAL MODELS OF PERFORMANCE SERVERS . Architecture that employs a journal assignment that can be created on demand when journal is created, and operates outside the business cycle. The assignment is routed to reviewers and approvers based on predefined company policy that users define. The assignment encloses a changelist of data changes created by the journal. The changelist is used for rendition and calculation for reviewers and approvers (in addition to the journal contributor) to view/verify and modify the data as if the data is already written into the model. At the time that other users access this model, the data is not present. At the end of the successful workflow chain the changelist is written into the model. If failed, the changelist will be used as that basis for correction or the user can discard the changelist.
