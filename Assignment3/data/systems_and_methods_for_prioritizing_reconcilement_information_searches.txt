SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PRIORITIZING RECONCILEMENT INFORMATION SEARCHES . Systems and methods are disclosed for assisting a check-cashing entity to efficiently and accurately locate relevant positive pay information or other reconcilement information regarding a check or other negotiable instrument that has been presented in association with a request to cash, deposit, use as payment or other otherwise accept the check or negotiable instrument. In various embodiments, when a plurality of potentially useful reconcilement information sources are selected for querying in association with a proposed check-cashing transaction from amongst a set of available reconcilement information sources, factors relating to the transaction, factors relating to characteristics of the information sources, and factors relating to preferences on the part of the check-cashing entity may be considered in order to select and prioritize the querying of information sources that are deemed likely to hold desired reconcilement information.
