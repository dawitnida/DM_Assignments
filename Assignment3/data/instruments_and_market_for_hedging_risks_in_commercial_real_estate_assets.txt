Instruments and market for hedging risks in commercial real estate assets . Real estate is known for its overwhelmingly idiosyncratic risk structure stemming from heterogeneous real assets traded on imperfect markets with asymmetric information, high transaction costs, low liquidity. In theory, property derivatives should be based on multifactor models cognisant of real estate's fundamental risk structure. In practice, no existing derivatives template can accommodate multi-factors. As a result, property derivatives usually offer poor hedging effectiveness, especially in the context of individual buildings and small, under-diversified portfolios of assets. The specification presents the design of two derivative instruments and market template that accommodate complex risk structures. These instruments and market enable investors to efficiently hedge risks involved in heterogeneous real assets such as commercial real estate assets.
