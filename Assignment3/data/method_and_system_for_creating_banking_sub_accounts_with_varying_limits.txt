Method and system for creating banking sub-accounts with varying limits . A system for providing credit card sub-accounts with varying credit limits is useful to consolidate many accounts into one account. The present invention allows a user to add others to an existing account with the safety of setting credit limits for each sub-account to prevent sub-account holders from abusing the user's account features, funds, credit limits, and the like. Credit limits for sub-accounts can be configured by an exact amount, a percentage of the total credit limit, a percentage of the credit available, or a combination of these methods, and can also be per transaction, type of establishment where transaction takes place, or types of products or services attempting to be purchased.
