IDENTITY VALIDATION FOR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS . Systems and methods for validating a party's identity for facilitating peer-to-peer loan transactions are provided. Drivers of a fleet of parcel delivery vehicles associated with a particular common carrier are used to collect information validating a party's identity. As part of a scheduled parcel delivery, or as an independent stop specifically for identity validation, a driver visits an address associated with a party (e.g., a consignor or consignee) and confirms the party's association with the address, such as by visually inspecting the party's driver's license or other identifying document. Information regarding the party's association is provided to a system accessible by a peer-to-peer lending facilitator. Input from the drivers relating to the association may be transmitted to a server via the driver's handheld device. The information can be used by the peer-to-peer lending facilitator to determine a level of risk associated with entering into a loan transaction with the party.
