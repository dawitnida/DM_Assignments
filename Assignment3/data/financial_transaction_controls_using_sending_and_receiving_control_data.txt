Financial Transaction Controls Using Sending And Receiving Control Data . A financial transactions control system may impose controls on the processing of financial transaction data that is generated by sending jobs and received and processed by receiving jobs. It may include a control data generating system associated with each of the receiving jobs configured to generate receiving control data that includes at least one total of financial transaction data received by the receiving job, a storage system configured to receive and store the receiving control data and sending control data from each sending job that contains at least one total of financial transaction data sent by the sending job, and an exception identification system configured to analyze the receiving and the sending control data and to communicate an exception when an error in the control data is detected. Sending job processing systems may each have associated control data generating systems of a similar type.
