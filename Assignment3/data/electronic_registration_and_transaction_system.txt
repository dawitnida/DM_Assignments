ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION AND TRANSACTION SYSTEM . One preferred embodiment provides mobile device based registrations and transactions by providing an aggregator, in the form of a server connected to the internet for collecting and selectively distributing user data. The aggregator may obtain the user data through the mobile network operator, a third party data source (e.g., a credit reporting bureau), or from one-time user input with the aggregator. The user can selectively transmit their user data quickly (e.g., with the selection of a single link) via their mobile device between the aggregator and a third party content provider (e.g., a gambling site, adult content site, banking site, etc.).
