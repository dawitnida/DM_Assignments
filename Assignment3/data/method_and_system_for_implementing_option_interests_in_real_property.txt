Method and system for implementing option interests in real property . The invention is a method and system of implementing option interests in real property. The owner of the property receives funds from an investor, which can be used to provide the property owner with income for living expenses or to use to lower the property owner's financing costs. In exchange for each payment, the property owner grants the investor a call option to purchase coupled with a put option to sell a fractional interest in the real property at some future date. The value of the investor's fractional share will increase along with the value of the property, allowing the investor to participate in rising property values. The owner does not pay interest on the monies received, leaving the cash flow for other purposes.
