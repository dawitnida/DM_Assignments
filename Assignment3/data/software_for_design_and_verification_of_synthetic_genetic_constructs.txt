SOFTWARE FOR DESIGN AND VERIFICATION OF SYNTHETIC GENETIC CONSTRUCTS . The present invention provides methods for designing and verifying nucleic acid molecules having one or more desired properties. The methods are typically encoded into software, and typically include use of databases and algorithms to determine if nucleic acid molecules designed to have various elements in functional relationships have the intended properties. The result is achieved by determining if the various elements of the designed nucleic acid are in the correct order and physical relationship to other elements, and that the proper elements are selected. Computer systems for implementing the method, as well as business methods for reaping monetary gain from use of the methods, are also disclosed.
