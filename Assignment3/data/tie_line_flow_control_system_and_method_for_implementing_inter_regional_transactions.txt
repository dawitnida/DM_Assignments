Tie-line flow control system and method for implementing inter-regional transactions . A tie-line control system and method. Tie-line flow control among selling entities is facilitated by an entity implementing transmission contracts for purchasing entities. The entity will execute the steps of receiving request bid curves for inter-regional transactions from selling entities; receiving demand bid curves for inter-regional transactions from purchasing entities; synchronizing the bid curves at a selected time interval; between synchronizing times, iterating information with the selling and purchasing entities to ensure clearing of supply and demand bids at a clearing time so that tie-line real and reactive power flows on the tie-lines interconnecting the selling entities are the same; communicating to the selling and purchasing entities accepted tie-line flow quantities and corresponding prices at the clearing time; and ensuring that all inter-regional transactions clear as agreed upon in the previous synchronized interval.
