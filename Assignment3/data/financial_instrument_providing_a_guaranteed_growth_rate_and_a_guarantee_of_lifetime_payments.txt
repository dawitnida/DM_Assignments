Financial Instrument Providing a Guaranteed Growth Rate and a Guarantee of Lifetime Payments . A method for providing a financial instrument includes determining an initial account balance associated with a financial instrument based upon an initial deposit amount, wherein the financial instrument includes an account with an account balance that changes over time. The method further includes establishing a first guarantee of a protected value, the protected value including at least an amount based upon the initial account balance growing at a minimum growth rate for a defined period of time or until one or more defined events occur, whichever is sooner; and establishing a second guarantee that a beneficiary may periodically receive a transfer of an amount of money for the life of a designated party, wherein the amount comprises a percentage of the protected value at the time of a particular event, provided that the amount may vary based upon withdrawals from the account in excess of a first particular limit.
