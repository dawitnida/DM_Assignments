System and Method for Evaluating a Security Traders Performance . The present invention is a method for evaluating one or many security trader's performance using technical analysis. The method of the present invention provides for the application of mathematically definable metrics by establishing a correspondence between an account balance and price while and at the same time creating a correspondence between volume and total cost basis amongst others. For a given period of time, it is possible to create progress charts to which analysis tools may be applied. This is accomplished by inputting the securities historical data related to volume and price over the course of a given time frame. With respect to volume, several metrics may be correlated: such as a trader's total transacted share volume; the percentage of a trader's capital currently invested; and the total cost basis dollar value.
