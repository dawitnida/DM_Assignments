Systems and Methods for Providing Loan Analysis . A data processing system provides loan analysis for a consumer eligible to receive loan services from a particular financial institution. The data processing system performs the loan analysis by determining every existing loan of the consumer reflected in a credit report from the credit report. Each of the determined existing loans having a loan type that is offered by the particular financial institution is matched with a respective replacement loan available at the particular financial institution. The data processing system then reports a comparison of one or more determined existing loans with one or more matched replacement loans.
