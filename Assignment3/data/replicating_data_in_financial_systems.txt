Replicating Data in Financial Systems . Systems and methods for replicating data communicated over a network. According to one embodiment, among several embodiment, a data replication system includes a first interface table and a first application associated with a first computing system. The first application is configured to transfer data into the first interface table. The data replication system further includes a first replication module, which is also associated with the first computing system. The first replication module is configured to replicate data from the first interface table into a second interface table associated with a second computing system via a network. The data replication system also includes a second application and a second replication module associated with the second computing system. The second application is configured to transfer data into the second interface table. The second replication module is configured to replicate data from the second interface table into the first interface table via the network. Furthermore, the data replication system includes a web service module configured to check the contents of the second interface table before the first application performs a specific processing operation.
