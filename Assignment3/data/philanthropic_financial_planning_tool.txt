Philanthropic financial planning tool . A philanthropic planning tool aids in planning multi-year staged donations by showing the tax consequences of a donation and the effect of the donation on an asset base across a number of years. The tax considerations for donations based on cash, securities or a mix of different assets can be displayed to assist the donor in selecting the appropriate donation size and structure.
