System for Funding an Organization . A system for funding an organization with cash flows derived from the death benefits of life insurance policies initiated within a bankrupt remote, special purpose entity having the same insurable interest as the organization, by paying the premiums of said policies with proceeds from the issuance of an asset-backed security through the securitization of said death benefits, requiring no use of cash value, no transfer of ownership or beneficiary of said life insurance policies, and providing guaranteed cash flows to said organization while keeping the initial insurable interest intact.
