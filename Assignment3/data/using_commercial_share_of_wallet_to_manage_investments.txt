Using commercial share of wallet to manage investments . "Commercial size of spending wallet (""CSoSW"") is the total business spend of a business including cash but excluding bartered items. Commercial share of wallet (""CSoW"") is the portion of the spending wallet that is captured by a particular financial company. A modeling approach utilizes various data sources to provide outputs that describe a company's spend capacity. Managers of investment vehicles, such as mutual fund managers, can use CSoW/CSoSW as one of the parameters to be considered when picking stocks to buy, sell, or short. Investment managers can also use CSoW/CSoSW to predict which stocks in their portfolio are likely to suffer a price fall."
