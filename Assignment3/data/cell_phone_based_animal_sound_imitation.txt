CELL PHONE BASED ANIMAL SOUND IMITATION . A cell phone based sound producing device is a sound producing device that takes advantage of the likelihood that a user is already carrying a cell phone and does not need to also carry an electronic sound producing device. Another advantage is that cell phones are designed to communicate across a communications network. As such, the cell phone based sound producing device can download call sounds from a server, store them, and play them. Electronic payment systems for ring tones and games that are played on a cell phone already exist. These electronic payment systems can be easily adapted for payment of sound producing device modules and sound producing device sounds. Recovery information can be used to restore modules and sounds that are lost due to cell phone breakage or upgrades.
