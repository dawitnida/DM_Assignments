Method and System for Loan Application Non-Acceptance Follow-Up . Methods and systems for facilitating post offer communication with a prospective borrower using an on-line lending system (110) are provided. The post offer communication is in response to non-acceptance of an electronic loan offer. The on-line lending system receives an electronic loan application (100) from client terminal (101). The electronic loan application (100) contains applicant credential data, such as personal information (202) and financial information (302). When a loan offer (500) is presented on the client terminal (101), the on-line lending system (110) waits a predetermined time for an electronic signal indicating acceptance of the loan offer (500). When such electronic signal is not received within the predetermined time, a pending loan offer application (800) is transmitted to a call center terminal (1414). Upon receipt of the pending loan offer application (800), the call center terminal (1414) presents an electronically generated prompt (1415) for electronically generated prompt (1415) a customer service representative to initiate communication with the prospective borrower.
