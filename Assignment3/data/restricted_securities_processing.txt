Restricted securities processing . A method and system is provided to automate many of the steps involved in processing restricted securities. Data can be received relating to restrictions associated with the trade of a security. Typically the data includes notification by a seller of their desire to transact a trade involving a restricted security as well as answers to a checklist of questions related to the restricted trade. In addition, the system can receive an electronic verification that the data is correct. The system can respond by automatically generating documentation supportive of the trade and receiving an electronic signature to execute the generated documents. Trade information can also be automatically forwarded to a clearing house. In addition, an instruction can be transmitted to a transfer agent to convert physical restricted securities into an electronic format. Notification that the securities have been converted can subsequently be received.
