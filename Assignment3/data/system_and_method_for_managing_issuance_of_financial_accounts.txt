System and Method for Managing Issuance of Financial Accounts . A system for managing issuance of a corporate meeting account for use in making purchases related to a meeting. The system comprises a communication interface adapted to communicate with a client computer executing an event management software and with a computer from each issuer, a processor coupled to the communication interface, and a management module executable by the processor. The management module receives, through the communication channel, a request to issue a financial account related to the meeting from the event management software. The request includes an issuer identifier and meeting account parameters. The management module generates an account issuance message and transmits the message to a computer of the issuer identified by the issuer identifier. This way, the process of opening a financial account associated with a meeting event is automatically done without having to manually contact the issuer.
