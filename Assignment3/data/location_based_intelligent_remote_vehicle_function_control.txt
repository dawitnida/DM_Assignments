Location-based intelligent remote vehicle function control . An in-vehicle monitor detects the occurrence of a meta-event related to the operation of a vehicle, such as the vehicle's operation over a maximum allowable speed, operation in a prohibited geographic area, operation during a specific time frame, or combinations thereof. The monitor signals a server via a wireless data link, and the server determines an appropriate deferred action to be taken by an in-vehicle controller, such as disabling the engine, limiting vehicle speed, and locking vehicle doors, upon occurrence of a second meta-event including conditions such as time delays, vehicle speed and direction, and vehicle location. The system can thereby allow orderly and safe control of vehicle functions for purposes such as terminating a pursuit, enforcing legal sentences and operator restrictions, and controlling fleet vehicle operations.
