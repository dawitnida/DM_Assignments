System and method for administering charitable funds through affiliations of professionals . An affiliation of professionals administers charitable fund accounts. The membership of the affiliation contains tax and estate planning attorneys, and/or accountants, and/or CPAs, and/or other non-financial oriented professionals. The fund is created through the affiliation by one of the professionals working with a donor to select and fund the charitable fund. The charitable fund is administered by the management team of the affiliation. The administration involves managing an asset held under the charitable fund to produce a return on the asset. The return on the asset is distributed to a charity or income beneficiary depending if it's a charitable foundation or charitable trust. The donor exercises direction over the distribution of the return on the asset to charities. Any revenue generated through administration of the charitable fund by the management of the affiliation is placed in revenue pools. The revenue is apportioned to members of the affiliation according to the contribution of the respective members to the generation of the revenue.
