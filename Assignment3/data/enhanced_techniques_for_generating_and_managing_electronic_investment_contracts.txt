Enhanced techniques for generating and managing electronic investment contracts . A computerized method for generating an electronic investment contract. The electronic investment contract provides enhanced flexibility through the use of one or more investor-selectable asset exposure parameters linked to one or more investment asset categories. These asset exposure parameters may be specified in the form of an allocation parameter associated with a corresponding response parameter, or in the form of an investment-percentage-weight parameter, or in the form of an amount-of-asset-exposure parameter. More specifically, an investment identifier is used to uniquely specify a corresponding investment contract. Each of one or more investment identifiers is associated with an investment amount and one or more asset category identifiers. The asset category identifier uniquely specifies an investment asset category. Each of one or more asset category identifiers is associated with a corresponding asset exposure parameter. In implementations that employ allocation and response parameters, the allocation parameter specifies an allocation amount to be indexed to the corresponding asset category identifier, and the response parameter specifies a relationship between the allocation amount and any subsequent price and/or net worth changes in the corresponding investment asset category.
