BUSINESS MODEL OF A BILLING PROCEDURE FOR RENTING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT . A system and method relate to dynamic financial models associated with financing, such as leasing or purchasing, equipment and/or services. The financial models may dynamically update a rate of payment based upon variable conditions. In one aspect, the financial models facilitate the lease of medical equipment. A rental rate for a piece of medical equipment being leased may be adjusted to account for changing conditions. The rental rate may be updated as a function of fluctuating health care insurance re-imbursement rates, fluctuating billing or other medical guidelines, the number and/or type of procedures being performed with medical equipment being leased, interest rates, and/or other factors. The dynamic calculation of the rental rate to reflect actual conditions may reduce financial risk posed to a medical practitioner or facility. Accordingly, a significant barrier of entering a highly specialized market associated with medical equipment and the medical services provided thereby may be alleviated.
