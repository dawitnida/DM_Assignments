System and method for using a first electronic representation of contract terms for generating a second electronic representation of the contract terms . Systems and methods are provided in which contract terms from a first electronic representation of a contract are used to form at least a part of a second electronic representation of the contract. For instance, the first electronic representation of a contract may be formed for use with a first software application, such as an adjudication application, and such first electronic representation of the contract is used by a system to form at least part of a second electronic representation of the contract, wherein such second electronic representation is used by a second software application, such as a contract management application. Disparate applications often utilize different representations of contract terms, and certain embodiments enable a second electronic representation to be formed by the system at least in part from a first electronic representation so that the different electronic representations are consistent as to the overlapping contract terms included therein.
