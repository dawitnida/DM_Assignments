New aperture design for improving critical dimension accuracy and electron beam lithography throughput . Disclosed is an improved aperture design for improving critical dimension accuracy and electron beam lithography. A pattern may be created on a reticle by passing an electron beam through a first aperture having a first shape comprising an upper horizontal edge, a lower horizontal edge, a vertical edge, an upper bevel, and a lower bevel, wherein a portion of the electron beam is projected onto a second aperture. The portion of the electronic beam is passed through the second aperture having a second shape, wherein the second shape is the first shape rotated horizontally by 180 degrees, and an overlapped portion of the first and second aperture is exposed on a surface of the reticle to create a pattern.
