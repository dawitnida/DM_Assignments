System and method for efficiently using collateral for risk offset . A system and method for analyzing correlation between the assets given by the trader for collateral and that trader's open positions is disclosed. Thus, if the collateral is correlated to the trader's open positions, then some offset can be given. If there is no correlation than the collateral is valued in the conventional way. For example, if a trader provides t-bills as collateral for an account that has open positions (e.g. short futures) in T-bills, than that trader's account can be credited with some offset since the value of T-bills and T-bill futures are highly correlated.
