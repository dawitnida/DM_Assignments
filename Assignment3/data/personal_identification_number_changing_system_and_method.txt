PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER CHANGING SYSTEM AND METHOD . Systems and methods are provided for enabling a cardholder to authenticate and change a current PIN associated with a chip card using a chip card interface device (CCID) having a chip card input/output device configured for interacting with the chip card. A PIN entry device receives from the cardholder a current PIN, which is communicated to the chip card along with a verify command. The chip card compares the current PIN input by the cardholder with the PIN stored on the chip card. If the cardholder input is verified, the cardholder can input a desired new PIN. The CCID then communicates a locked PIN through a host to the issuing bank's backend system, which unlocks the PIN and stores the desired PIN. The backend system then creates a PIN change script including the new PIN and communicates the script to the chip card over the network. The chip card runs the script, which instructs the chip card to store the new PIN in place of the previous PIN.
