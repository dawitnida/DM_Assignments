Method of financing and maintaining a railway track . The present invention proposes a leasing arrangement of composite railroad ties constructed of, for example, recycled automobile tires, to a customer over a lengthy term while ownership in the ties remains with the supplier/leassor. The leasing arrangement can be spread over twenty years or longer, such that the initial start up costs is a fraction of that for wood ties, much less composite ties, and the customer also realizes the benefits of the enhanced durability of the composite ties. The supplier may also agree to replace the composite ties as necessary, and thus the customer has a fixed and manageable annual (or other incremental) cost that provides predictability and low cost insurance that is not available for purchased ties.
