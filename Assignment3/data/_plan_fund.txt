Mailings would contain the website address of an internet program to help guests make contributions. The website URL, seemingly specific to each guest, allows them to add money to the account by credit card or direct deposit on a one time, periodic or whenever desired basis.

Couple could login to view by percentage/dollar/ or graphic illustration, total progress of account.
