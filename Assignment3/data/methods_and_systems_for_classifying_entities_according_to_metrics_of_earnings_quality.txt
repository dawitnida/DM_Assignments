Methods and systems for classifying entities according to metrics of earnings quality . Methods and systems for classifying entities according to metrics of earnings quality are provided. At least one value corresponding to earnings quality of an entity is generated based on at least one metric of accruals, and the entity is classified according to the at least one value. For example, the entity may be classified according to the value as likely to have overstated its earnings and/or as likely to experience one or more business outcomes (e.g., a change in stock price, SEC enforcement action, and/or class-action lawsuit). As another example, multiple entities may be separated into various classes by ranking the entities according to their respective values. Such a ranking may provide useful heuristics regarding whether the entities have manipulated (e.g., overstated or understated) their earnings. Information about the classification may be made available for a fee and may allow parties to make better business and regulatory decisions.
