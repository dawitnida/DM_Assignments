Automated Compliance Management of Endowments Throughout Their Life Cycle . A method, system and program are disclosed for the automated enforcement of compliance controls for a plurality of endowments throughout their lifecycles, comprised of life cycle phases that include: requisition, qualification, authorization, provision, obligation, termination, and end of life. Compliance controls for endowment objectives, constraints, resources, and results is similarly enforced. An on-line request is made for an endowment, which is automatically transitioned from one life cycle phase to another once predetermined compliance control metrics have been enforced and met. Transition through each of the endowment's life cycle phases is further controlled by the automated enforcement of predetermined compliance control metrics for endowment objectives, constraints, resources, and results.
