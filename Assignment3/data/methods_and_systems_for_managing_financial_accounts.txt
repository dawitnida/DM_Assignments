Methods and systems for managing financial accounts . Computer-implemented methods and systems for managing a special-purpose financial account involve establishing the account by a financial institution for a consumer relating to at least one consumer-designated future purchase for a pre-determined purchase price. Thereafter, contributions to a principal balance of the account are received and interest is accrued on the principal balance by the financial institution until the principal balance and accrued interest reaches a consumer-designated target amount, at which time, the principal balance and accrued interest are disposed of according to pre-defined parameters that can involve forfeiture of the accrued interest, depending on the consumer's actions.
