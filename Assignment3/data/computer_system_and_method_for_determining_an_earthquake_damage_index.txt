Computer System and Method for Determining an Earthquake Damage Index . In a computer system and a computer-implemented method for determining a damage index indicative of damage caused by an earthquake to a portfolio of objects associated with a geographical area, local portfolio replacement value indices are stored assigned to object or grid coordinates of the geographical area. For each coordinate having a local portfolio replacement value index assigned to it, a local damage index is calculated from location, depth, and magnitude data related to the earthquake and from the local portfolio replacement value index, using local vulnerability and attenuation parameters. The damage index is calculated by aggregating the local damage indices for the grid coordinates. For any size of the geographical area and for any resolution of the grid, a damage index reflecting the geographical distribution of the portfolio objects can be determined, without need for a network of seismological measurement stations distributed in the geographical area.
