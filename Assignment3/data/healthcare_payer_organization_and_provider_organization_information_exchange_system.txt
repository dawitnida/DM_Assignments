Healthcare payer organization and provider organization information exchange system . A system provides access by healthcare payer organization personnel to information maintained by a healthcare provider organization. An acquisition processor acquires and collates information from one or more healthcare provider organization information systems including: patient medical eligibility determination related information; patient admission, discharge, and transfer related information; and patient clinical information. An authentication processor verifies that a healthcare payer organization user is authorized to access the acquired collated patient information in response to user entered identification data. A user interface generator provides data representing a display image including elements of the acquired and collated information to an authorized user in response to user command.
