Electronic balance checking and credit approval system for use in conducting electronic transactions . An electronic balance checking and credit approval system includes consumer transaction accounts, tokens, input devices, authentication hardware and software, and output devices. The consumer transaction account is held in trust on behalf of a consumer by a credit extending company. The token is specific to and held by the consumer, and includes a consumer account identifier that is associated with the consumer transaction account. The input device receives the consumer account identifier concurrent with a consumer-initiated request for account balance information. The authentication hardware and software verifies the consumer-initiated request and the consumer account identifier and authorizes access to the consumer transaction account. The consumer interface apparatus provides the consumer with a real-time account balance datum that is currently associated with the consumer transaction account. The system also includes a system and method for securely and quickly approving credit card transactions by comparing generated checksums with stored historical transaction results.
