Trading System for Handling an Order Matrix . An exchange system and a method for trading orders on an exchange market and a related broker workstation. One or more user defined order matrixes allows a user to design a trading strategy by manually, or by means of algorithms using current and/or historical market data, determine trading parameters such as part order size, price level, time delay between consecutive part orders. An order having a total volume and at least one such order matrix associated therewith is received from a market participant. The order matrix specifies predetermined portions of the order's total volume. A first portion of the order's total volume is determined in accordance with the order matrix and information is sent to display the that portion to the market. A next portion of the order's total volume is generated in accordance with the order matrix and information is then sent to display that portion to the market.
