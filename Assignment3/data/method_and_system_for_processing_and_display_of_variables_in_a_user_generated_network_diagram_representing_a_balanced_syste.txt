A computer system and a computer implemented method for processing and display of variables in a user generated network diagram representing a balanced system, wherein the variables represent stocks and flows of resources and key ratios being ratios of linear combinations of flows and/or stocks of resources. A user interface is used for graphically creating a balanced system in the form of a network diagram having: one or more nodes, at least one input flow from a giving system into a node, at least one output flow from a node into a receiving system, and/or one or more flows between nodes.
