System and method for charitable donations . A method and system is provided, in which an interfacing device is distributed free by a value net integrator to end users, or supporting parties, whose normal use thereof may benefit a soliciting entity, such as a charity or social group, through various forms of interactive advertising, combined with an interactive and good will based referral incentive program. The interfacing device may comprise a special toolbar to identify and locate the participating third party vendors; to enable supporting parties to access a search engine partner for Internet searches, where the search engine partner agrees to provide a commission to the value net integrator on a per-click basis; and to allow supporting parties to easily make direct contributions to the soliciting entity. The special toolbar may provide additional value to encourage its use by the supporting parties, such as providing an intelligent pop-up blocking capability. The value net integrator may collect the commissions generated by the supporting party's use of the special toolbar, pay a royalty to the soliciting entity out of the commissions on a periodic basis, and retain the remainder as compensation for its services.
