Scaling order matching beyond one processor in exchange systems . Methods, articles of manufacture, and systems are provided that may be utilized to increase the rate in which orders may be processed for a given security by balancing the trading load over a number of local books. For example, when a monitored amount of order volume for a book reaches a threshold amount, an additional book may be created and the order volume may be distributed among multiple books. As a result, multiple processors may be used to process the orders locally (e.g., at the same exchange), thus increasing order processing bandwidth. When the order volume for the security declines, books (e.g., originally opened to handle an increased order volume) may be closed, as deemed appropriate
