Measurement and verification protocol for tradable residential emissions reductions . The present invention is directed to a system and method for quantifying residential emissions reductions. In particular, the system and method may comprise the steps of: measuring an energy savings resulting from an energy savings opportunity in a residential property, calculating an emissions reduction resulting from the energy savings, aggregating a plurality of emissions reductions into a tradable commodity, monitoring the residential energy savings opportunities, monitoring the quantification of the emissions reduction, and verifying the quantification of the emissions reduction. The system may include means for conducting each of these steps.
