Trading method for trading between trading systems and trading system . In a trading method for trading financial products between first and second trading systems, if an order to buy/sell a product as received in a first trading system is not completed within a prescribed time, an order notice is transmitted to a second trading system at a predetermined timing. The second trading system makes a search to detect whether a reverse order is present, locks therein a reverse order thus detected, and transmits an order instruction according to the reverse order. The first trading system then executes the buying/selling in response to the order instruction, and transmits an execution result in response to the order instruction to the second trading system. The second trading system executes the buying/selling for the locked reverse order, based on the results of the execution performed by the first trading system.
