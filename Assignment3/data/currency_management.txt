Currency management . Management of currency inventory within and among network nodes of a financial network (e.g., bank branches, ATMs, and kiosks) may involve receiving information of currency inventory at one or more nodes in the network, generating a forecast for currency demand for the one or more nodes based on the historical currency demand for the one or more nodes, and establishing a currency transportation plan that includes a currency delivery schedule for the one or more nodes, wherein the currency transportation plan is based on the currency inventory, the forecast for currency demand, and one or more costs of handling currency. The costs of handling currency may include costs such as the expected loss from robbery and other currency theft.
