Financial methods and systems . Computer-implemented methods and systems support financial decisions by searching for securities or portfolios similar to one or more reference securities or portfolios; alerting a user when the number of references to a selected financial instrument on at least one selected Web site exceeds a predetermined amount; and/or enabling a user to graphically display financial entities and dynamic relationships between them.
