SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF RANKING A PLURALITY OF CREDIT CARD OFFERS . Prescreened credit card offers, such as offers for credit cards that a particular potential borrower is likely to be granted upon completion of a full application, are ranked based on expected values of respective prescreened offers. The expected value of a prescreened credit card offer may represent an expected monetary value to one or more referrers involved in providing the prescreened offer to the borrower. Thus, the referrer may present a highest ranked credit card offer to a potential borrower first in order to increase the likelihood that borrower applies for the credit card offer with the highest expected value to the referrer. Depending on the embodiment, the expected value of a credit card offer may be based on a combination of a bounty associated with the offer, a click-through-rate for the offer, and/or a conversion rate for the offer, for example.
