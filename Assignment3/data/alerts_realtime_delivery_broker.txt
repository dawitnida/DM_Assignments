Alerts Realtime Delivery Broker . "All messaging vendors today receive ""jobs"" (SMS, Voice or eMail) from their customers and attempt to deliver through their delivery infrastructure. Being that all vendors have a limited capital investment in delivery infrastructure, their customers ""jobs"" will deliver (first in first out) over time which can range from in minutes to hours. This model is critically flawed for the emergency alert industry which requires a large pool of capacity at a moment's notice. What differentiates Alert Realtime from all other Messaging companies is our ""Delivery Broker"" technology that will utilize the capacity of multiple Alerts Messaging companies creating a much larger single pool of delivery capacity. At peak times or during a catastrophic event when emergency alerts are in demand, Alerts Realtime will delivery via multiple partners and multiple modalities mitigating the delivery capacity constraints the rest of the industry faces."
