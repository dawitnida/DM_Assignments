Method and system for automatically identifying discrepancies from sale of a gift card . A method and system for automatically identifying discrepancies resulting from the initial sale and servicing of a third party gift card using a central reconciliation system. The central reconciliation system receives and analyzes gift card sale transaction data from multiple sources. A first source is a point of sale, such as a booth or kiosk at a store or shopping center, the second source is a processor, and a third source is a bank. The central reconciliation system receives transaction data associated with the gift card sale from each source and automatically analyzes and compares the data to identify any discrepancies so that any discrepancy can be resolved. Reports can be generated on-demand via menu-driven selections or options showing the discrepancies and reconciliation thereof, and the reports can be accessed by a user via a standard network connection, such as the Internet, or provided to a user.
