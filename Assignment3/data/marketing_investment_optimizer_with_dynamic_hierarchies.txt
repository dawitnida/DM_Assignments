MARKETING INVESTMENT OPTIMIZER WITH DYNAMIC HIERARCHIES . A hierarchal view preserving relationships between data is generated by storing information related to sales and investment. The information includes dimensions and each of the dimensions includes a level and each of the levels is described by variables. Relationships between the variables are also stored. A request for a hierarchy is received. The requested hierarchy includes a set of dimensions from the stored dimensions, a level for each dimension in the set, and a sequence of the dimensions or levels in the hierarchy. A computer system calculates values for the variables in the levels for the requested hierarchy using the stored relationships that are applicable to the variables in the levels. A view of the hierarchy is generated and includes the calculated values. The view also includes the dimensions or levels of the requested hierarchy in the sequence specified for the requested hierarchy.
