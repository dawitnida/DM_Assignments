Systems and methods for acquiring, managing, placing, collecting and reselling debt . "A system is provided for comprehensive debt management. Debt is typically acquired in the form of portfolios from the issuers of debit (e.g., creditors, such as credit card banks), which are referenced herein as ""primary issuers"" of debt. The custodian of the present invention is the acquiring party and is referenced as the ""secondary issuer"" of debt. Such portfolios are normally expansive and may cover a very large geographically region, such as the state of Texas. The system can parse the debt and assign any portion thereof to collection agencies or even directly to individual collectors."
