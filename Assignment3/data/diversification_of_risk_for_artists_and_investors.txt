Diversification of risk for artists and investors . A business model for the diversification of risk in connection with works of art includes accepting from various artists works of art to be pooled in a collective investment fund. A financial instrument is issued to each particular artist in consideration for one or more works of art contributed by that artist to the fund. Revenues are generated on behalf of the fund through commercialization of the works of art in the fund. A portion of the revenues is distributed among the artists participating in the fund according to vested interests in the financial instruments held by the artists. A particular artist having a vested interest in one of the financial instruments is entitled to receive an amount of the revenues based on the collective commercial success of the works of art contributed to the fund by all the artists.
