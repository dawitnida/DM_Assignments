Allocation of residual value risk . Residual value risk may be allocated for a leased vehicle between a dealer organization and a manufacturer group, where the manufacturing group may include both a financing institution and a sales organization. In one embodiment, residual value risk may be allocated by first calculating a difference between a residual value for the leased vehicle and the vehicle's actual value. This difference may then be allocated between the manufacturer group and the dealer organization according to some predetermined ratio which represents a corresponding financial obligation or benefit, depending on if the difference is positive or negative.
