Automated administration of endowments throughout their life cycle . A method, system and program are disclosed for the automated administration of a plurality of endowments throughout their life cycles, comprised of life cycle phases which include: requisition, qualification, authorization, provision, obligation, termination, and end of life. Endowment objectives, constraints, resources, and results are similarly administered. An on-line request is made for an endowment, which is automatically transitioned from one life cycle phase to another once predetermined criteria have been met. Transition through each of the endowment's life cycle phases is further bounded by predetermined endowment objectives, constraints, resources, and results.
