METHOD OF SAVING FOR A TIME DELAYED PURCHASE . A method of saving for a time delayed purchase includes establishing a savings account through a website provided by a third party service provider. The savings account establishes the savings goal, the time frame, the recommended contribution, and the savings category and/or category of retailer(s). Once established, a customer designates the account as public or private. For a private account, funds are transferred from the customer's financial institution based upon approved parameters. For a public account, a notification is sent to potential third party contributors who make a gift to the public account that is held by the service provider. The customer is given the option of accepting the gift, whereby funds are transferred from the service provider to the public account.
