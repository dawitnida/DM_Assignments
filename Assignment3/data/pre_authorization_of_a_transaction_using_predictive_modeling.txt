PRE-AUTHORIZATION OF A TRANSACTION USING PREDICTIVE MODELING . Systems, apparatus, and methods are provided for efficiently authorizing a transaction initiated by a consumer. An authorization can be generated before the consumer actually initiates the transaction. For example, a future transaction can be predicted, and an authorization can be generated for the predicted transaction. In this manner, the authorization can be ready and quickly used when the consumer does initiate the transaction. Previous transactions made by the consumer can be used to predict when the future transaction is likely. In various examples, the authorization can be sent to a specific merchant or to the consumer for use when the consumer initiates the predicted transaction, or saved by an authorization server for use in response to an authorization request from the merchant.
