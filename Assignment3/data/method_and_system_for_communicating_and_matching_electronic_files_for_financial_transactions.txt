Method and system for communicating and matching electronic files for financial transactions . "Communicating and matching electronic files for a check adjustment case comprises communicating an electronic check adjustment message comprising key data relating to the case, communicating an electronic image of a document to follow (""DTF"") related to the case, associating the key data with the electronic DTF image, determining whether the electronic message's key data matches the key data associated with the electronic DTF image, and linking the electronic message to the electronic DTF image in response to a determination that the electronic message's key data matches the key data associated with the electronic DTF image. If the DTF image's key data does not match the message's key data, matching electronic files can comprise correcting errors in the key data associated with the electronic DTF image and performing a secondary match routine. An operator accesses the electronic message and the linked DTF image to resolve the check adjustment case."
