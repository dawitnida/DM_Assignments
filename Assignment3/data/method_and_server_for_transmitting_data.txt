Method and server for transmitting data . A method transmits data relating to a payment operation from a mobile communication terminal (KEG) to a payment system (ZS1, ZS2) in a communication network (GPRS). A server (S) in the communication network uses a first communication protocol (OTA) to receive payment data which come from an application program (A) running on the communication terminal. The server recognizes the communication terminal and the application program (A). The server uses a second communication protocol to transmit the payment data to the payment system (ZS2). In addition, the server transmits terminal data identifying the communication terminal to the payment system, which informs the payment system about the payment debtor. The server also transmits program data identifying the application program to the payment system, which informs the payment system about the payment receiver.
