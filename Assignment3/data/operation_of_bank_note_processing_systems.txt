Operation of bank-note processing systems . A bank-note processing system comprises bank-note processing machines (M1-M4) set up in a room (R) and adapted to be individually operated wirelessly by a control unit (BE). In dependence on the position of the control unit (BE) within the room (R) the control unit is configured by the closest machine (e.g. M4), for which purpose said machine (M4) passes machine-typical data to the control unit (BE) in a log-in procedure. The control unit (BE) can be used to wirelessly operate different bank-note processing machines even of different types. This simplifies operation, on the one hand, and permits simpler realization of security measures, on the other hand, e.g. the limitation of operation to certain operating functions for certain groups of persons within one and the same room.
