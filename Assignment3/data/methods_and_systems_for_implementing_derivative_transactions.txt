Methods and systems for implementing derivative transactions . Methods and systems are provided for executing a futures transaction for a customer. A record of a stored-value account is maintained on behalf of the customer at a host system. The record includes an identification of a level of value stored in the stored-value account. A request is received at the host system for approval for the customer to be a party to a contract having a defined future execution date or date range. The request specifies an amount of value due from the customer upon execution of the contract. An approval is recorded by modifying the record to include a specification of terms of the contract. A request for execution of the contract is received at the host system during the defined execution date or date range. The level of value stored in the stored-value account is reduced by the amount of value in response to receipt of the request for execution of the contract.
