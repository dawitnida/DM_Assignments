Computer-based optimization system for financial performance management . A system for analyzing and optimizing allocation of factors among different business entities. The analysis, or optimization, can be targeted to a specific business financials measurement, or metric. Many different types of factors can be considered regardless of their initial definition, description or form. For example, along with revenues, profit, inventory size, etc., human characteristics such as incentive and performance can be measured and optimized. A preferred embodiment of the invention concerns analyzing factor allocation to reduce overall taxes for a company with subsidiaries in regions with different tax laws. The system includes consideration of local, state, federal and international taxes, transfer pricing, tax credit limitations, inter-state allocations in unitary and non unitary environments, carry-overs, and others. The system preferably uses a versatile matching engine, described herein, to automate the analysis and optimization. The matching engine is capable of discrete and continuous attribute value weighting, and of performing substitution of attributes, or other variables.
