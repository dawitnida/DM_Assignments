System and method for saving the rainforests. . The present invention tries to solve the problem of rainforests destruction by creating a strong financial incentive that makes preserving the rain forests much more profitable than destroying them. Preferably the idea of sustainable harvesting is combined with the idea of selling real acres to people and making sure that these acres are indeed under supervision and protection and that preferably as many of them as possible are preferably also used for sustainable harvesting, and this is preferably combined with a recursive multi-level marketing plan with various sophisticated improvements over the prior art. In addition, this invention describes an improved model of carbon-rights trading and/or of trading of other rainforests values or rights, so that preferably the model works with a formula that requires saving additional rainforests land from the trading revenue in order to avoid keeping the total amount of destruction the same.
