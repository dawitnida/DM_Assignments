EQUITY BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN . An equity based incentive compensation plan is established by acquiring shares of an equity security by grant and by purchase using funds loaned by a third party. The risk of the loan may be abated using various strategies including employing a forward contract between the lender and a third party. The amount of the loan repayment amount may reflect the cost to the lender or entering into the forward contract with the third party. The computer system of the invention manages plans including calculating the ratio of a plan's loan repayment amount(s) to the value of the plan's shares that are collateral of the loan.
