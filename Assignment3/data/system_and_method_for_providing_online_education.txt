System and Method for Providing Online Education . A system and method for creating and offering online courses and classes provides a computer program accessible over a computer network. The program includes a template for creating a course by assigning predefined attributes and/or parameters, and by adding lessons, activities, and/or material in conformance with predetermined rules. A selected course is converted into a class for offering over the system which may be archived or deleted after the term. New classes may subsequently be made from the original course. Included are translation and/or conversion functions, wherein inputs and outputs may be translated between human languages and/or converted between different analog and digital forms, and a payment system wherein fees may be charged for access to the system, a course, and/or a class. Courses and course content may be saved and shared with other users having valid access parameters.
