Systems, methods and computer program products for modeling demand, supply and associated profitability of a good in an aggregate market . A method is provided that includes defining a plurality of independent component markets for a good. In accordance with the method, each component market can be defined a respective price sensitivity distribution of a unit purchase of the good, as well as a market potential distribution of a number of units of the good. The demand and/or supply in the aggregate market can thus then be modeled based upon the price sensitivity distributions and market potential distributions of the component markets. The method can further include modeling cost and/or profitability of the good in an aggregate market. Profitability can be modeled based upon the demand model and the cost model for the aggregate market.
