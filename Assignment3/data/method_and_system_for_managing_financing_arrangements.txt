Method and system for managing financing arrangements . Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and system for de-coupling a customer side from an investor side in software for supporting financing arrangements. According to the embodiments, a link object may be arranged between customer objects and investor objects, and handle operations that need to be performed because of a relationship between the customer objects and the investor objects. The link object therefore effectively de-couples the customer side from the investor side, since there need not be any direct association between the customer and the investor side. A more flexible solution for the needs of financial business is accordingly provided.
