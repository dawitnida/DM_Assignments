System and method for preparation of personal income taxes . The present invention is a system and method that reduces the taxpayer's burden of tax preparation and provides greater accuracy in the calculation of tax return figures. The invention provides for a centralized data repository service which collects tax information on behalf of the citizenry (a financial recording service provider), indexes the data by a personal identifier, and allows the taxpayer to either recall the data for use on yearly income tax returns or enables the government or a third party to access the data, prepare the taxpayer's tax return and file the tax return with the appropriate governmental taxing authority.
