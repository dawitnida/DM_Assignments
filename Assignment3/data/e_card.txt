E-CARD . A touch screen navigation device for making purchases includes a memory to store a first descriptor that identifies a card used in commerce; a scannable identifier adapted to provide a second descriptor to a scanner; a display for displaying changeable information including an icon for the card; and an input to select the card. When the card is selected, the display takes the appearance of the card, and when the scannable identifier is scanned, the scannable identifier provides the descriptor in the memory that identifies the card. A page bar may scroll between pages of icons. Interfaces may be included for E-apps, E-games, paying-bills, music and video, books, and text messaging.
