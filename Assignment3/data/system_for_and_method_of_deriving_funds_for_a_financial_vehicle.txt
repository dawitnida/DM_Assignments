System for and method of deriving funds for a financial vehicle . A system for deriving funds for a financial vehicle such as an investment fund on behalf of a customer comprises means for inputting data on financial transactions to a customer account. The processor running the account increases the value of each transaction as to an amount related to the amount of the transaction by rounding it up to the nearest pre-set currency unit value and adds the increase in the amount to a notional accrual account. At the end of an accounting period the entries in the accrual log are totalled, debited to the money transmission account and transferred to the financial vehicle on behalf of the customer automatically.
