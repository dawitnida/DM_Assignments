Web-based automated code delivery . A method for preventing disablement of a device includes assigning a contract identification code, receiving a loan payment, forwarding the loan payment from a payment center to a finance company having an interest in the device, a code delivery computer determining whether the finance company has received the payment, the code delivery computer determining a previous code released for the device, releasing a new code subsequent to the previous code released for the device if the code delivery computer determines that the finance company has received the payment, the code delivery computer receiving the associated contract identification code from a user via telephony or an internet link, the code delivery computer providing the new code directly to the user via telephony, an internet link, or an email, and the device receiving the code from the user, thereby preventing disablement of the device.
