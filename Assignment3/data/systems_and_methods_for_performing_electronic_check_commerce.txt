A secure and convenient electronic check transaction processing system that allows a customer and a merchant to agree on terms of a payment.

The processing system provides a user-friendly interface that allows the user to easily set up the electronic payment schedule. The processing system also provides a back end process that carries out the scheduled payments and handles any returned payments.
