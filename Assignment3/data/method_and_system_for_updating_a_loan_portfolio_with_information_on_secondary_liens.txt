METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR UPDATING A LOAN PORTFOLIO WITH INFORMATION ON SECONDARY LIENS . A computer-based method of updating a client loan portfolio with information on secondary liens relatable to portfolio properties includes inputting property data from the portfolio, monitoring a secondary lien database for secondary liens relatable to the property data, and notifying the client if a secondary lien is detected. Notifying the client may include generating a secondary lien report containing an AVM score or a CLTV ratio, and updating the portfolio by generating a new version of the portfolio that includes secondary liens detected during monitoring. A system may include a client station for inputting data for monitoring, an FTP server for uploading the data from the client station, and a mainframe server for standardizing the data, searching databases for secondary liens, calculating the AVM score and CLTV ratio, and generating the secondary lien report for delivery to the client station via the FTP server.
