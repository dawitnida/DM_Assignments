IDENTIFYING AND SHARING COMMON TRENDS . Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, systems, and machine-readable media for identifying and sharing common trends represented in a corpus of private information without revealing the private information. Identifying and sharing common trends can comprise reading a first set of private information and a second set of private information. The first set of private information can be compared to the second set of private information and common information between the first set of private information and the second set of private information can be identified. Once identified, a determination can be made as to whether the identified common information represents an emerging trend, i.e., the common information re-occurs or develops over time. In response to determining the identified common information represents an emerging trend, the emerging trend can be reported without revealing the first set of private information or the second set of private information.
