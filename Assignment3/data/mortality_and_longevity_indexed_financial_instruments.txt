Mortality And Longevity Indexed Financial Instruments . Financial instruments are indexed to a standardized measure of publicly available longevity and mortality demographic data. A first financial instrument includes a zero-coupon bond and Experience Coupons. The zero-coupon bond accrues interest over its term at a base interest rate. The Experience Coupons, which are responsive to differences in actual and projected longevity/mortality data, either supplement or erode the value of the zero-coupon bond according to the direction of the differences in actual and projected longevity/mortality data. A second financial instrument is a swap in which counterparties trade expectations that actual mortality or longevity experience will be better or worse than projected mortality or longevity experience for a selected population cohort.
