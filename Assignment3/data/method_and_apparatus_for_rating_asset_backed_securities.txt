Method and apparatus for rating asset-backed securities . "Share of Wallet (""SOW"") is a modeling approach that utilizes various data sources to provide outputs that describe a consumer's spending capability, tradeline history including balance transfers, and balance information. These outputs can be appended to data profiles of customers and prospects and can be utilized to support decisions involving prospecting, new applicant evaluation, and customer management across the lifecycle. The likelihood of default determined by the SOW model, when applied to a loan portfolio, can reduce the amount of credit enhancement required for an asset-backed securities rating."
