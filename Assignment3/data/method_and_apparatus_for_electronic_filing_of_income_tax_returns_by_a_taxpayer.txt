Method and apparatus for electronic filing of income tax returns by a taxpayer . The present invention is a unique business process system that looks like a free-standing ATM, internet access kiosk, video game, or check cashing kiosk. The present invention is a self-service tax preparation and electronic filing (e*file) device for Federal and State income tax returns. The Present invention allows consumers without access to a computer, the internet, a major credit card or a bank account to take advantage of electronic filing, direct deposit, refund anticipation loans (RAL), refund anticipation cashier's checks (RAC), and refund transfers (RT) without having to hire and pay a human tax preparer. The present invention will be placed in public locations, such as discount stores, grocery stores, postal service stores, malls, colleges and universities, and other retail or public locations. While using existing hardware and software that are in the public domain, the present invention's unique business process eliminates the need to pay live preparer fees, allows all taxpayers to access electronic filing and bank products, and reduces fee loads for lower income taxpayers while still allowing them access to now unavailable products such as e*file and RAL. The present invention is novel and unobvious in that all tax preparation has previously required either self preparation on paper, visiting a paid preparer, or owning a computer with access to the internet. It is useful in that it greatly expands access to e*filing and bank products (RAL, RAC, RT) and sharply reduces consumer costs for using these services.
