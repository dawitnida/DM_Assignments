CARD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD . A method of registering a credit card user's credit card information by a credit card management organization. A card user accesses the card management computer system in a computer network. The method provides a user interface whereby the user grants authorization to the card management organization to obtain the card user's credit report from a credit reporting bureau. The method further transmits a request for the user's credit report to a credit reporting bureau and automatically downloads the user's credit report when received. The method further parses the credit report to determine a card issuer for each card on the credit report using a database of card issuer aliases. The method then fully or partially automatically registers each card with the user's account in the card management association and then presents the opportunity to the user to review and edit each card.
