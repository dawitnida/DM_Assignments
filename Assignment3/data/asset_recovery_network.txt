Asset recovery network . "Electronic asset disposal request forms are created, approved, and forwarded to a surplus property disposal professional who then may modify and supplement the electronic request forms to create electronic postings that are accessible over a computer network to interested potential buyers. The potential buyer may then create an offer which is processed electronically. The surplus property professional may have discretion to determine which potential buyers are eligible to participate and whether to invoke an automated ""last and final"" bidding process, as well as the ability to select between a simple ""for sale"" posting and a ""closed bid"" posting. Details of pending auctions may be automatically circulated to participants in prior auctions of similar items and to other registered buyers who have expressed interest in those types of items. The result is a flexible mechanism that is fair and efficient for all concerned."
