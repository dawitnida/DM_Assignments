Currency dispense and control system with anti-theft features . A cost-effective, currency dispense and control system (CDCS) securely dispenses paper money in one of the following modes: (1) an ATM system and (2) a currency control system that allows a merchant or merchant-approved employee to withdraw cash from the CDCS independent of a standard ATM electronic fund transfer (EFT) network. The CDCS may also include the following functionalities: a duress dispensation system that allows the CDCS to activate an alarm and/or otherwise communicate with local police or security services during a robbery, a time-release system that effects a time-delayed dispensation functionality, and a user identification and authentication system for authenticating a user identity and determining eligibility of the user to access the currency control system.
