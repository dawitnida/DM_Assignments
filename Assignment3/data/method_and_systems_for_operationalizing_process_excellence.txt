METHOD AND SYSTEMS FOR OPERATIONALIZING PROCESS EXCELLENCE . "Method and systems for operationalizing process excellence. An execution methodology of the invention can meld process excellence with various tools and incorporate activity-based financial modeling, and an operating efficiency model. The overall process can be divided into sessions which can include pre-work, as well as characterizing ""as-is"" and ""to-be"" processes. The goal of the sessions is to create a continuous improvement productivity loop. The processes of the invention can be aided by apparatus including an instruction execution platform operable to store and execute computer program code instructions for implementing a plurality of the tools for use in characterizing the as-is and a to-be processes. One or more of these tools can be implemented in the form of a spreadsheet. A data store can be operatively connected to the instruction execution platform by a network to supply historical data and store results."
