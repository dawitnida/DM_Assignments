Variable momentum monitoring system . A variable momentum monitoring system including the steps of:receiving from a user an identification of a required variable data input; obtaining the current live static value (LSV) of the identified required data input from a dynamic live data-stream and determining it as a base reference input (RI); calculating at least two sets of one or more incremental reference variable levels (RVLs) using the determined RI, one of the sets having values less than the RI and the other set having values greater than the RI; searching dynamic live data values (LDV) of the identified required data and comparing with the reference variable levels (RVLs); communicating to the user when the current live value of the identified required data matches with any of the reference variable levels (RVLs).
