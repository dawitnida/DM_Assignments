Chapman Icon Charting . A method for using a computer to execute the electronic transformation of data into a visual depiction, the method comprising the steps of recording the values of a plurality of data points during a data period; recording the creation sequence of the data points; executing the electronic transformation of the plurality of data points into a visual depiction by using a computer; displaying the extreme values of the data points by using a first substantially straight line having two tips such that a first tip of the first substantially straight line represents the upper extreme and the second tip of the substantially straight line represents the lower extreme; displaying the first data point of the data period by using a second substantially straight line that is substantially perpendicular to the first substantially straight line; displaying the last data point of the data period by using a third substantially straight line that is substantially perpendicular to the first substantially straight line; indicating the first extreme value by using a fourth substantially straight line that connects a first tip of the second substantially straight line to the tip of the first substantially straight line that designates the first extreme value; indicating the first data point of a closing timeframe and the last data point of the closing timeframe by using a fifth substantially straight line that connects a first tip of the third substantially straight line to a point on the first substantially straight line; displaying a value scale at the same time and in combination with displaying the first substantially straight line.
