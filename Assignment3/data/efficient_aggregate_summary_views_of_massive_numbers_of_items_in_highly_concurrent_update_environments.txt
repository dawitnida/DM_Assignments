Efficient aggregate summary views of massive numbers of items in highly concurrent update environments . A method and system improves efficiency of highly concurrent aggregate summaries updates by delaying the updates to as late as possible in the transaction, while maintaining an accurate in-progress aggregate summary for use by transaction in progress. The system uses a temporary table to store updates to aggregate summaries and consolidates the temporary table with the aggregate summary to create a view of the accurate in-progress data for use by the transaction. Prior to the transaction commit, the system converts the contents of the temporary delta table into a single-statement consolidated update of the inventory summary table, reducing throughput delays caused by write locks early in the transaction.
