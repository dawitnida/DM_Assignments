System and method for automated payment and adjustment processing . A system and method for automated adjustment processing using pre-configured sets of business rules is provided. The seller pre-configures a set of business rules for use in processing an adjustment for a specific buyer. The set of business rules may be variable for each buyer and/or globally set. When a payment is received from a seller and an adjustment is required, an adjustment management application retrieves the buyer's set of business rules from the seller. The set of business rules are then applied to attempt to match the received payment to one of the buyer's outstanding invoices. If the match is successful, the buyer's payment is processed.
