MULTIPLE RATE CURRENCY CONSOLIDATOR . A multiple currency rate consolidator addresses the needs of multi-national companies that do business in different currencies and tax localities. A consolidated view of financial data may be provided in real time. The multiple currency rate consolidator allows each subsidiary within a subsidiary hierarchy to enter and manage transactional data as well as budget/forecast data in a corresponding localized functional currency. The multiple currency rate consolidator allows different consolidation levels to view localized, consolidated values of subsidiary transactions. The multiple currency rate consolidator also accommodates statutory, ad hoc and management reporting consolidation using different subsidiary configurations for the same time periods, as well as the versioning of the subsidiary hierarchy to accommodate structural changes across different time periods.
