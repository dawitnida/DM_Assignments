Method and arrangement for playing back media contents . "An improved method and an improved arrangement for video on demand is provided. It is provided according to the invention that a VoD user can select media contents from the multiplicity (""library"") of media contents offered by a VoD provider and add said contents to a virtual loan resource assigned to him or, as the case may be, his terminal device (104). The user can view contents contained in this virtual loan resource as often as desired; charge tickets for the subsequent charging for the use are generated at regular intervals, for example for each day or every 24 hours, for as long as the media content to be charged for resides in the virtual loan resource of the user. The user can terminate the loan by means of a ""virtual"" return of the borrowed media content; the media content is removed from his virtual loan resource and is then no longer available to the user. The virtual loan resource is formed by means of pointers to the media contents borrowed in each case."
