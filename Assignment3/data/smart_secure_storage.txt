SMART SECURE STORAGE . "A healthcare smart card management system stores a large amount of healthcare information to overcome shortcomings of separate and largely paper medical and insurance files. Embedded security technology supports partial or separated identity proofing as well as hardware time limited storage. Dynamic contextual privacy consent enhances user, healthcare provider, and insurer privacy and proprietary information to encourage and enable universal adoption. Data is structured in self-executing (""print to device"") for legacy systems as well as in rolled-access format and archival format to balance usage and data integrity purposes. A plurality of network interfaces are incorporated as well as financial transaction codes. Card integrity is enhanced by remote usage oversight, self-destruct monitoring (e.g., time, location, hacking, malfunction, etc.), and integral write-only audit logs. Levering excess storage capacity, a user can store related healthcare information such as exercise regimen, diet journal, emergency contact information, urgent medical conditions for first providers, etc."
