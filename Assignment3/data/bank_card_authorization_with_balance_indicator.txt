BANK CARD AUTHORIZATION WITH BALANCE INDICATOR . Systems, methods, and computer program products are provided for providing a consumer with information about the balance of the consumer's credit or debit account after a transaction, such as a purchase transaction, is made using the credit or debit account. In one embodiment, the issuing bank attaches a number representing the balance of the consumer's credit or debit account and/or other information about the balance to the authorization code when authorizing a purchase transaction so that, when a vendor provides the consumer with a purchase receipt that has the authorization code on the receipt, the balance information is automatically included on the receipt with the authorization code. In this way, the consumer can keep track of spending by knowing the total balance of the consumer's credit and/or debit account and/or other balance information after each credit or debit card purchase.
