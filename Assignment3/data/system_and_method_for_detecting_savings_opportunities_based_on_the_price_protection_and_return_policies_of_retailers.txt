SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETECTING SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON THE PRICE PROTECTION AND RETURN POLICIES OF RETAILERS . A system and method is disclosed for detecting savings opportunities for consumers based on the price protection and/or return policies of retailers, following a process of purchasing items from online or physical retailers. The system receives an order statement which comprises information about an order, such as an identifier of the retailer, a date and the details of one or more purchases, where each purchase includes at least an identifier of an item and the amount paid for that item. The system then extracts that information from the order statement, without requiring the user to specify the details of each purchase separately. The system continuously monitors the prices of the items and the conditions specified in the retailer's price protection and/or return policies. If the system determines that the customer is eligible to receive a refund or can profit from returning an item to the retailer and re-purchasing it (perhaps from a different retailer), it either requests the refund from the retailer on behalf of the customer, or notifies the user.
