Investment management tool . The following describes an investment management tool based on dynamically linked and re-configurable portfolio building blocks. These building blocks are graphical structural elements of an investment portfolio that represent either individual investments or the hierarchical groupings of individual investments in a multi-tiered investment structure. The portfolio building blocks provide access to a variety of identity/position specific investment tools and they can be individually programmed and dynamically linked to form a highly flexible, hierarchical portfolio management system. The portfolio building blocks when created, structured and linked into an operational portfolio provide an easily manipulated portfolio investment and information management toolkit that dramatically clarifies and simplifies the process with which individual investors can create and manage a portfolio of equities in an investment account.
