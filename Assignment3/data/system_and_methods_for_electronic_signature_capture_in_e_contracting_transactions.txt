SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE CAPTURE IN E-CONTRACTING TRANSACTIONS . A system and method for generating, executing and maintaining electronic contracts in connection with indirect financing transactions involving an acquisition by a customer of an asset offered by a vendor with financing provided by an independent finance source. In one example embodiment, the system includes en e-contracting component configured to generate an electronic contract having one or more signature fields. The contract further includes a contract identifier and one or more signature identifiers embedded therein. The e-contracting component provides the generated electronic contract to one more contracting parties, including the customer, the vendor and the finance sources.
