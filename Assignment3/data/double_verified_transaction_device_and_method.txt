Double Verified Transaction Device and Method . The disclosed technology comprises methods and devices whereby a device associated with a payer or user, such as a handheld wireless device, communicates an authorization to pay a merchant and also communicates to a financial institution, either directly or indirectly, a version of the authorization. A confirmation of the payment after verification of each communication is then received, in embodiments of the disclosed technology. In this manner, a transaction is carried out only after the device authorizes the transaction to both a merchant and a financial institution, the authorizations taking place substantially simultaneously or being delayed until both authorizations can be sent out from the device.
