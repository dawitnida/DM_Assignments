Methods, systems and computer program products for generating an aggregate report to provide a certification of controls associated with a data set . Methods for generating an aggregate report to provide a certification of controls associated with a data set include identifying sources that generate information to be included in the data set. A plurality of controls associated with the identified sources are identified. At least one of the controls is selected as a key control. The key control is tested to assess its efficacy as a control for its identified source. The key control is modified to adjust its efficacy based on the testing of the key control when the efficacy fails to satisfy a criterion. An aggregate report is generated on the plurality of controls based on the testing of the key control to provide a certification of the controls associated with the data set.
