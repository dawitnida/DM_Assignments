METHOD AND PORTABLE APPARATUS FOR SETTLING TRANSACTION . A method and portable apparatus for settling a transaction are provided, in which the portable apparatus may be used as a card substitute payment device for settling a transaction. Information to conduct a settlement may be stored in the portable apparatus. The portable apparatus may be, for example, a portable phone or a PDA. A transaction inquiry machine may read or receive the information from the portable apparatus, similar to that of a card reader reading a magnetic card, and transmit the information to a VAN company server or a card company server, to then request for an approval to settle the transaction.
