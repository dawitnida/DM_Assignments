System, method and computer program product for evaluating and rating an asset management business and associate investment funds using experiential business process and performance data, and applications thereof . A method, system and computer program product for evaluating and rating an asset management business and their associated investment funds, including both traditional and alternative managers (i.e., hedge funds) is disclosed. The evaluation of an asset management business and associated investment funds is performed by extracting experiential infrastructure and investment performance data that exists on the computer systems of asset management firms and their outsourced service providers. Experiential infrastructure and investment data includes qualitative and quantitative information compiled or derived from operating systems, databases, applications, electronic files and records that relate to the asset manager's investment and infrastructure performance. Investment and infrastructure performance data also includes transactional and computational records as well as security and portfolio information supporting investment activity and infrastructure business processes. A set of metrics and a series of algorithms is used to measure and rate an asset management business in terms of investment and infrastructure performance. The evaluation and rating method includes: 1) measuring investment and business performance; 2) analyzing and interpreting the measures; 3) putting the results into a contextual framework; and 4) computing an overall rating for an asset management business based on both investment and infrastructure performance.
