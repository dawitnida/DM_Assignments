Internet-based customer referral system . A method and apparatus for a customer to purchase a product or service from a merchant website on the Internet is provided. The customer selects a hyperlink from an associate web page that is related to a merchant supplied product. The associate server then acts as a middleman between the merchant server and the customer computer in a manner that permits the associate to automatically earn a commission for and personally track each electronic referral and/or sale. The requested web page need not contain any hyperlinks to the merchant server and the associate need not register with the merchant or receive an associate ID from the merchant.
