System and method for high-yield returns in riskless-principal interest rate/yield arbitrage . "A system, method and strategy of investment can be executed in any currency and amount and, when constructed, can be executed and closed in certain steps to result in a pre-defined, guaranteed and quantifiable level of profitability for an investment without risk that the principal investment amount will be lost or depleted. The system, method and strategy also simultaneously guarantees the following results for all other transaction participants: (a) a pre-defined level of profit for the Investor and/or his Asset Manager (""Manager"") and the lender for the refinancing or discounting; (b) an option to call which when executed by the original issuer of the instruments will result in a profit for the original issuer (e.g. insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms, financial institutions, and/or corporations); (c) an exit strategy that allows each and every participant in the transaction to exit its original position without exposure to ongoing currency fluctuations, changes in interest rates and yields, or default by the issuers of financial products."
