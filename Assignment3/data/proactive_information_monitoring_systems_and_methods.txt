Proactive Information Monitoring Systems and Methods . Systems and methods for proactive information monitoring are presented. A user can define alert criteria for generating an alert through a centralized alerting service where the alert criteria relate to the status of records in a data set. The records of the data can be distributed across multiple remote or unaffiliated databases to which the user lacks access. The service can disaggregate the criteria into individual criterion targeting specific records stored in the databases. The criterions are provided to agents that monitor the records. When the records satisfy the criterion, the agents send notifications back to the service. Once the service receives sufficient notifications to indicate the alert criteria are satisfied, the service sends an alert to designated recipients. The systems and methods are able provide alert information without compromising the confidentially or security of the remote databases.
