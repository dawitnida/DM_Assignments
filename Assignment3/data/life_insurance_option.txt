Life insurance option . A method of providing deferred life insurance through a life insurance option. The deferred life insurance becomes effective later in the life of an insured after the option matures. The insured pays at least one payment during a first period for the deferred life insurance policy option. The deferred life insurance policy is inactive during the first period, and becomes effective at the beginning of the second period when the option matures. The insured pays at least one payment during a second period, which follows the first period, for the deferred life insurance policy, assuming the insured lives this long. The insured is entitled to a benefit based on the deferred term life insurance policy only in the event of death of the insured occurs during the second period. Payments for the life insurance option can be made by a person who is the insured or on behalf of another person who is the insured, such as a child or other third party. The individual payments and sum of payments can be structured to suit the insured's financial objectives, while providing incoming funds to an insurance company. The deferred life insurance policy can be used in conjunction with a conventional life insurance policy, such as conventional term and whole life insurance policies.
