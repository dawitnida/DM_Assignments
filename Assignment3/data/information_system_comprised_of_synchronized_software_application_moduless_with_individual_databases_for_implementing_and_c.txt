Information system comprised of synchronized software application moduless with individual databases for implementing and changing business requirements to be automated . A method and apparatus for a fully integrated Information System (IS) with modules for each business activity, that can be used individually or grouped in a suite of modules, each module containing its own individual database, and connected via a middleware-like integration device, or Enterprise Service Bus, for network based data synchronization and communications, that connect the modules to each other and to existing ERP, CRM, data warehouse and custom legacy systems. Each module therefore acts more efficiently since it is not burdened by the tasks of interfacing with the hardware platforms and operating systems, which are assigned to the programs in the integration server. These smaller and more flexible modules work together and automatically update all related applications, databases and users, when data is entered into one. The modules are quickly implemented as they are written from libraries of core functionality from existing programming code that were developed for implementing similar business requirements, added to custom code, thus quickly and inexpensively implementing precise individual business requirements, fully integrated with the existing legacy IS environment. The invention is considered a next generation ERP technology that can easily adapt to new requirements as market places and best practices dictate. It is called SAIDware and it is especially suited for the migration of legacy systems to more modern platforms, facilitating their step-by-step replacement as time and budgets allow.
