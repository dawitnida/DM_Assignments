System and method for facilitating the selection of security analyst research reports . A system and method for facilitating the selection of security analyst research reports is provided. Investors (or other users) seeking to efficiently target and access only those security analyst research reports most likely to assist in an investment-related decision may access an application. The application may enables users to simultaneously view (e.g., via a graphical user interface) current predictions of security analysts (or other contributors), research report objects associated with the predictions, and data, metrics, or other information corresponding to the historical performance of predictions made by the analysts. By simultaneously displaying historical performance data for contributors, along with their current predictions and research report objects associated with their current predictions, users are provided with objective criteria by which to guide their selection of research reports.
