METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REBROKERING ORDERS IN A TRADING SYSTEM . Systems and methods are described herein for supporting the trading of bonds in a computerized system using broker dealers as intermediaries. Broker dealers receive orders relating to particular transactions and have the option to accept the order by submitting a matching counter order, or to rebroker the order with the same or modified terms to a number of other investors or additional broker dealers. The additional broker dealers have similar options, thus providing a system wherein orders can be quickly proliferated to a large number of parties. This order proliferation can be fully or partially automated through the use of predefined rules stored in a database which dictate for each broker dealer whether, to whom and under what terms to rebroker orders. When an order is received, the system processes all such rules to output a set of orders which are then communicated to the corresponding parties.
