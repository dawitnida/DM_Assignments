SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FACILITATING AGGREGATION OF SOCIAL CREDITS . Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for facilitating the aggregation of carbon reduction credits resulting from finance loans financing the purchase of energy technology. For example, a credit aggregator may receive from a finance institution estimate parameters describing a loan type. The credit aggregator may calculate a value of a carbon reduction credit associated with each loan of the loan type considering the estimate parameters and display the value to the finance institution. In addition, the credit aggregator may receive bid data and booking data from the finance institution. When a credit is booked, the credit aggregator may receive from the finance institution periodic indications of a status of the intervention technology.
