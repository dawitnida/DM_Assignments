Banknote-handling system . A banknote-handling system includes a plurality of banknote-handling machines (11, 12, . . . ); a plurality of banks (16, 17) for accounting purposes, etc; a co-ordinating central unit (10); a transport system (18, 19 . . . ) for transporting banknotes between the machines and the banks; a central bank (15) for monitoring the activity and banknote-handling of respective banks; and an electronic information and signal transmission system (1-2) for enabling individual and cooperative activities of the units to be achieved. The information and signal transmission system (1-2) is divided into two subsystems. One subsystem (1) includes the transmission of information and signals that relate to and have their basis in transactions between the banks (16, 17) and the general public/businesses relating to their activities in respect of banknote-handling. The other subsystem (2) includes the purely administrative and technical signal transmission required for the requisite co-operation between the various units included in the system, for instance co-ordinating central unit-vehicles, banknote-handling machines-banks, within the banknote-handling system.
