SHARED APPRECIATION LOAN MODIFICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD . Embodiments of the present invention provide systems, methods, and computer program products for modifying the terms of a loan and for providing for a shared appreciation loan program. For example, in one embodiment the amount owed on an existing HELOC is split into two portions. A qualifying borrower can defer the obligation to pay interest and payments on a portion of the HELOC in exchange for sharing up to 50% of the future appreciation in the real property that serves as the underlying security for the HELOC. This mortgage plan can provide an incentive for the borrower to remain in the home since the borrower may be able to share in the appreciation of the home even if the home never appreciates beyond the full amount owed on the home, while at the same time preserving the borrower's credit rating and reducing the borrower's monthly payment. The bank may benefit from the mortgage plan by both reducing and deferring losses.
