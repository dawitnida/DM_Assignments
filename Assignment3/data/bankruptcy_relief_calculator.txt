BANKRUPTCY RELIEF CALCULATOR . Bankruptcy relief calculator. A calculation program can make a relatively objective determination as to whether to file for relief from a bankruptcy stay relative to a particular account and associated collateral. Using historical statistics on bankruptcy filings as well as information about the collateral and depreciation of the collateral, the calculator can make an estimate of depreciation saved by the filing and compare that estimate to the cost of a filing. The calculator can then produce a recommendation as to whether to file for relief or to wait for the bankruptcy to be discharged in its normal course. The invention can be implemented via a stand-alone computing system or such a system interconnected with other platforms or data stores by a network, such as a corporate intranet, a local area network, or the Internet.
