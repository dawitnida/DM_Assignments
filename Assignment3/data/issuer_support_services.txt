Issuer support services . A process, residing on a server, provides issuer support services to a financial market. A compliance process reviews issue and issuer data and filing and financial data, which is received from a first data source and concerns a specific issuer and one or more securities issued by the specific issuer, to determine if the specific issuer is in compliance with the listing requirements for the market on which the one or more securities are traded. The compliance process generates compliance data indicative of the specific issuer's state of compliance.
