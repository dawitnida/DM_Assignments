SYSTEM AND METHOD OF CREDIT DATA COLLECTION AND VERIFICATION . A system and method for verifying a stream of payments includes accepting a request for verification and, optionally, supporting documentation relating to the payments from a user such as a consumer and transmitting the request and the supporting documentation to a verifier who is unknown to the consumer at the time the request is made. The verifier directly contacts the payee to verify the payment stream. If the verifier indicates that the payment stream has been verified, the consumer is notified and given the opportunity to designate a third party recipient to whom the verification will be sent.
