Image sharing system . In image sharing systems where work is carried out in collaboration by a plurality of computers connected via a network sharing an image, problems occur where results displayed for content of operations for each terminal do not coincide. In the image sharing system of the present invention, a synchronization server is added to a related image sharing system, and the occurrence of mismatches in content displayed at the images of each image sharing terminal are resolved by sending content of operations of each image sharing terminal to a synchronization server once so as to bring about synchronization.
