Fusion classification for risk categorization in underwriting a financial risk instrument . A system, process and computer program product for underwriting a financial risk instrument application represented by at least one risk attribute is provided. Decision engines examine the at least one risk attribute associated with the financial risk instrument application and assign the application to one of a predetermined set of risk classes. A fusion engine compares the risk classes assigned by each of the decision engines and fuses the assigned risk classes into an aggregated result representative of the risk of the financial risk instrument application. The fusion engine includes a first multi-classifier fusion module that uses an associative function to fuse the assigned risk classes into a first aggregated result and a second multi-classifier fusion that uses a non-associative function to fuse the assigned risk classes into a second aggregated result. A comparison engine selects one of the first aggregated result generated from the first multi-classifier fusion module and the second aggregated result generated from the second multi-classifier fusion module and compares it with a production result generated from the production decision engine. The comparison engine generates an underwriting decision for the financial risk instrument application according to the comparison.
