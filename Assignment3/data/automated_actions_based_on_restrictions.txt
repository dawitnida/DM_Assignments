AUTOMATED ACTIONS BASED ON RESTRICTIONS . A technique for resolving a violation of an investment account restriction is provided. The restriction is associated with the holding of one or more securities in an investment account. A restriction definition and an associated resolution rule are stored in a data repository. A received order to perform an investment account management action is processed to determine that performance of the action violates the stored restriction definition. The associated resolution rule is then retrieved based upon the determination and then executed. Indications of the determined violation and of the executed resolution rule are stored in the data repository.
