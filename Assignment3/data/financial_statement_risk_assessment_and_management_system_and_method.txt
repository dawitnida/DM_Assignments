FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD . A method, computer readable storage medium, and information processing system analyze sources of internal organization financial information and decisions made that impact the risk of reporting errors in cash and non-cash components in line items of external financial reporting statements such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. The information processing system displays to a user, via a user interface, cash and non-cash components of at least one line item of an external financial reporting statement, the internal decisions and judgments made to arrive at the cash and non-cash component amounts, and the risk of reporting errors being introduced in each line item due to these decisions and judgments.
