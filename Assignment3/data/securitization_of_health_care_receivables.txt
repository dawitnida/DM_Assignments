SECURITIZATION OF HEALTH CARE RECEIVABLES . A method, system, and control program for expediting payment of claims to service providers and to reduce institutional capital reserves. The method includes evaluating a risk of full payment of each claim; grouping claims from a service provider(s) based on a commonality of risk; generating a security representative of the risk of the grouped claims and an investment value of the security; and exchanging a pre-payment amount to medical service providers for the security. More specifically, evaluating the risk of full payment includes comparing each individual claim to a database of historical performance of the service provider and of similar claims and, moreover, evaluating for each claim an expected payment amount and an expected time (or delay) of payment by an obligor.
