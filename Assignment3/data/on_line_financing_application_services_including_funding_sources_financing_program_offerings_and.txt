On-line financing application services including funding sources, financing program offerings and brokers/vendors association . An on-line financing application service (FAS) is equipped with functionalities to enable multiple funding sources to create multiple financing program offerings on-line. The FAS also facilitates the funding sources to selectively associate selected ones of the financing program offerings to multiple brokers/vendors, who in turn may create derivative financing program offerings, apply for financing, apply on behalf of their clients, or facilitate direct application by their clients, under selected ones of the financing program offerings on-line. The FAS is also equipped to allow an application submitted for consideration under a financing program offering to be automatically approved or referred to another rate sheet for quoting, another financing program offering of the same/different funding source/broker for consideration. In one embodiment, the automatic approval or referral is based at least in part on the business profile and credit information of the applicant.
