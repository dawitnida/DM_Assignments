SECURITY PRICING METHOD AND SYSTEM . The present invention includes a method and system implemented using a general-purpose computer known as Security Pricing System that generates target price and price indicators for traded securities such as stocks, bonds, and related indices, composites and derivative instruments. The method includes receiving historical data and optional forward-looking projected data related to securities, developing a security pricing model, and creating a security pricing tool that utilizes received historical data and the developed security pricing model to generate target price and price indicators. The target price can be used to evaluate expected gain/loss from holding a position in a security through comparison with current bid/ask prices. Price indicators such as price channel, divergence, support level, velocity, and momentum provide additional insight regarding the price spread and appreciation potential, direction and intensity of price movement, and investor sentiment. Price indicators can be used to identify, evaluate, analyze, and derive other conclusions or recommendations regarding security price and its investment potential. The system optionally includes a decision support tool for creating and managing an investment portfolio that uses the method and system of the present invention for defined investment objectives and styles.
