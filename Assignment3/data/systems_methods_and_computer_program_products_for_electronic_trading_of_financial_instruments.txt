Systems, methods and computer program products for electronic trading of financial instruments . An internet-protocol based anonymous trading system which enables traders to identify bids and offers which they are eligible to trade based upon a color coded methodology which gives the trader credit preference information about the potential counterparty while still maintaining the anonymity of the potential counterparty. To that end, each bid or offer is prescreened against all possible counterparties' credit information in the system and each counterparty sees a unique color coded trading interface based upon their particular credit preference combinations and the others in the system. The system then shows all prices in the system, and the color coding tells the trader which prices he is able to trade, and also shows him the full depth of the market, including those the trader is unable to trade.
