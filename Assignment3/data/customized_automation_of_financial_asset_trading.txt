Customized automation of financial asset trading . The present invention pertains to a system and method by which a financial assets trader (e.g., bank/broker/foreign currency manager) who normally executes trades in the financial assets marketplace may be able to process orders with minimal human interference in a truly automated, yet customizable way, thereby avoiding that which would normally require manual filling. Customized automation utilizes streamed rates and may be provided according to a client and/or institutional preferences by use of specific execution rules.
