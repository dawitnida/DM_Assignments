APPORTIONING FRAUD LIABILITY . After receiving a notice as to the occurrence of an unauthorized access to financial account information for one or more accounts sufficient for completing one or more financial transactions using the financial account information, a financial service provider assesses the liability for the particular compromise event by analyzing the industry-wide distribution of fraud that would have occurred had the compromise event not occurred, and calculates an incremental amount of fraud that accrued as a result of the compromise event. The incremental fraud is then apportioned to the responsible parties.
