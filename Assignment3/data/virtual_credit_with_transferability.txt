Virtual credit with transferability . A method and system provides credit arrangements in simulated environments. A user can participate in credit transactions to acquire virtual products, virtual services, and/or virtual items of value. Feedback is provided to the user regarding results of the credit transactions. In some embodiments multiple users can make simulated purchases or incur simulated credit obligations posted to virtual accounts, and can also make simulated compensation against balances due or obligations owed. The user may also have an opportunity of engaging in related real-world financial transactions. In some implementations, multiple players at different locations can use virtual charge accounts and/or real world accounts for arranging or resolving a virtual credit transaction. Some embodiments enable a debtor obligation and/or a creditor right arising from a virtual credit transaction to be transferred to another party, in some instances without having to obtain any permission for such transfer.
