Unit-Based Prepaid Presentation Instrument Accounts And Methods . Methods and/or systems for providing preauthorization and transaction settlement for a transaction using a prepaid unit-based presentation instrument are disclosed, wherein the presentation instrument includes a unit balance. The method may include receiving a preauthorization request that includes a price-per-unit and a preauthorization amount. The methods and/or systems may then determine whether the unit balance is sufficient to cover the preauthorization amount. If the unit balance is sufficient to cover the preauthorization amount, the presentation instrument is authorized for the transaction. If the unit balance is insufficient to cover the preauthorization amount, a currency balance is determined from the unit balance and the price-per-unit, authorizing the presentation instrument for a transaction up to the currency balance and sending an indication that the currency balance is authorized for the transaction.
