Systems and methods for constructing a value index and a growth index . A method of constructing a value index and a growth index is disclosed. The method includes, determining a value of each variable in a group of variables for each security in a group of securities, determining a standardized score of each variable for each security, and determining an overall value standardized score and an overall growth standardized score for each security. The method further includes positioning each security in a two-dimensional style space and allocating each security to at least one of the growth index and the value index based on each security's distance from an origin of the two-dimensional style space.
