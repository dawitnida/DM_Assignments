Apparatus and method for assessing market conditions . An apparatus and method for assessing market conditions, or for analyzing of other parameters that appear to fluctuate randomly, compare the changing conditions to the changes that would be predicted by Brownian Motion. If the changes exceed those predicted by Brownian Motion, a trend is considered to exist and can be expected to continue, while if the changes are less than those predicted by Brownian Motion, then a congestion condition exists. If enough measurements are taken, it may be possible to predict how long the trend or congestion will last. Preferably, the computation necessary to analyze the data on the condition being monitored is distributed among computers of subscribers to the monitoring service.
