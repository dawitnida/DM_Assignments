Trust-linked debit card technology . A revenue-producing debit card system and method for users who have bank accounts includes a trust account and plural debit cards. Each debit card is linked to a trust account that allows overnight balances to be invested at a profit for the benefit of the account holder. The system also includes a link between a bank account of a user, a debit card of the user, and the trust account, so that the debit card is linked to a bank account that is a pass-through, net zero balance bank account. The trust account includes a trust sub-account of the user, and the cash balance required to settle card transactions of the user is each time transferred from the trust sub-account of the user. The bank account of the system is used only to book a simultaneous debit and credit for the bank account each time the debit card is used by the user at a remote merchant location, and to report card activity usage. The method also creates a legal structure (e.g. a trust) in which the debit card user is a beneficiary and the user's ownership interest in the trust is evidenced by issuance and delivery of a floating trust-participation receipt. The user's beneficial interest in the trust fluctuates as debits and credits are posted to the user's bank account. The user's percentage ownership in the trust is the pro-rata of his account balance at any point in time relative to the total amount of money in the trust.
