Electronic transaction verification system . An electronic transaction verification system for use with transaction tokens such as checks, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards, that gathers and transmits information about the transaction token and biometric data. The system preferably has the ability to read or scan transaction and account information printed or encoded on the transaction token, digitally encode biometric data, scan drivers' licenses or other identification cards, and take a signature of a customer, all at a transaction location for purposes of account verification. The electronic transaction verification system preferably digitizes various indicia of the token, such as the magnetic ink (MICR) line on a presented check or the magnetic strip on a credit card or debit card, and transmits the transaction information data to a central system, at which the central system compares the inputted data with an existing database of information to determine if the customer at the point of the transaction is in fact authorized to use the account, and if the account is in satisfactory condition for approval of the transaction. The electronic verification system includes a biometric data device for recording and/or transmitting biometric data taken at the point of the transaction. The device alternatively prints the biometric data on, or in conjunction with, the token, either in actual or digitally encoded form, such that the biometric data can be checked subsequently against a database at the time the token is processed at a financial institution. The system alternatively includes a device for scanning an information card which contains biometric data such as a proper fingerprint and/or a signature, and the remotely gathered data can be compared to the recorded data on the card, in addition to or instead of, transmission of the gathered data to the electronic, biometric and signature databases.
