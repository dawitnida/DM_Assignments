Stored value account for use with virtual coupons . A system and method for the purchase of products, wherein a database account is credited with virtual coupons. Each virtual coupon is associated with a maximum value and a specified product. When a purchase is made, the coupon is debited from the account upon presentation of a financial card at a POS terminal, and any difference between the maximum value of the coupon and the actual purchase price is stored in the database. In one embodiment, coupons are issued through a government benefits program, such as the federally funded WIC (Women, Infants, Children) program. The financial card may also be associated with a second account, such as a credit or debit card account. The second account may be used to purchase products other than those specified by the virtual coupons.
