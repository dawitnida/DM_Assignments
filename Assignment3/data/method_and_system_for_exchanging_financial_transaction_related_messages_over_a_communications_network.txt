METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR EXCHANGING FINANCIAL-TRANSACTION-RELATED MESSAGES OVER A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK . At a first functional entity, a financial-transaction-related message destined for a destination associated with a second functional entity is received. The financial-transaction-related message is assessed for compliance with a fundamental message format and, upon assessing that the financial-transaction-related message is not compliant with the fundamental message format, a translation of said financial-transaction-related message into a translated message that is compliant with the fundamental message format is effected and the translated message is released towards said destination. The translated message is then received at the second functional entity, and the translated message is assessed for compliance with a message format that is employed by the destination. Upon assessing that the translated message is not compliant with a message format that is employed by the destination, the translated message is translated into a re-translated message that is compliant with a message format that is employed by the destination.
