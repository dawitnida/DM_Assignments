Grants management system . A system and method for managing grants received from one or more sponsors is proposed. The grants management system receives a transaction request and retrieves data associated with the transaction request from a data cube. The grants management system then determines, from the perspective of the sponsors, if the transaction request satisfies administrative and financial requirements imposed by the sponsors. If the administrative and financial requirements are satisfied, the transaction request is admitted.
