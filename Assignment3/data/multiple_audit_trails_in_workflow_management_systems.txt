Multiple audit trails in workflow-management-systems . Proposed is a mechanism for writing audit trail records in a Workflow-Management-System (WFMS) which comprises the steps of: Assigning a multitude of audits trails as potential targets for audit trail records to said WFMS, and Assigning an audit trail distribution strategy to said WFMS, comprising a specification which of said potential targets to be used for writing an audit trail record, and Dynamically analyzing for a current audit trail record said distribution strategy and determining a current target from said multitude of audit trails, and Writing said current audit trail record to said current target. By the proposed mechanism the contention on the audit trail is reduced. Therefore by implementing the present invention the response time of requests, processing time of process instances, and the throughput of the WFMS is improved.
