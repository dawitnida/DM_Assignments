Method and system for managing a non-qualified deferred compensation program using hedging . "A compensation tracking system provides not only plan tracking at the plan participant level, but also plan participant payment benefit tracking (also referred to as ""payout bucket"" tracking). Such systems may require that plan participant account balances be capable of being allocated into several targeted investments or indexes. In the context of benefits that are hedged using qualifying hedging transactions, the qualifying hedging transactions are broken down into an aggregate of mini-hedges attributable to each plan participant's possible benefit payments."
