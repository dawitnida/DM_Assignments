Spectral method for sparse principal component analysis . A method maximizes a candidate solution to a cardinality-constrained combinatorial optimization problem of sparse principal component analysis. An approximate method has as input a covariance matrix A, a candidate solution, and a sparsity parameter k. A variational renormalization for the candidate solution vector x with regards to the eigenvalue structure of the covariance matrix A and the sparsity parameter k is then performed by means of a sub-matrix eigenvalue decomposition of A to obtain a variance maximized k-sparse eigenvector x that is the best possible solution. Another method solves the problem by means of a nested greedy search technique that includes a forward and backward pass. An exact solution to the problem initializes a branch-and-bound search with an output of a greedy solution.
