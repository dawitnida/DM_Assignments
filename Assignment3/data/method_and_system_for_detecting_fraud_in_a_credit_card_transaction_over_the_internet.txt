METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTING FRAUD IN A CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION OVER THE INTERNET . A computer-implemented method is disclosed, where first information that is related to a current commercial transaction that is being evaluated for fraud is received, either directly or indirectly, from a consumer through an online service or internet. The computer obtains an internet address from which the first information is received from the consumer. In response to obtaining the internet address, the computer accesses at least one database to obtain a second information on a plurality of commercial transactions that have been previously associated with the internet address from which the first information is received from the consumer. An indication is produced on whether the current commercial transaction is fraudulent based on correlating at least one subset of the second information and at least one subset of the first information.
