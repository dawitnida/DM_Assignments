Computer-Implemented Systems And Methods For Integrated Model Validation For Compliance And Credit Risk . Computer-implemented systems and methods are provided for model validation of a model for compliance and credit risk. Model input, output, and processing validation areas are contained on a computer system. A handle data structure connects the model validation areas with handles that comprise a unified metric. A handle represents combinations of covariate patterns and describes the joint distribution of risk characteristics.
