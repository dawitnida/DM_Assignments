Method for applying insurance to a loan for real property . The invention is directed to a method for applying mortgage guaranty insurance to a loan for a real property to be made by a lender to a borrower, which includes covering the lender for a loss arising from a default on the loan, independently of the reason for the default, wherein the coverage provides a separate monetary limit for loan defaults involving one or more undisclosed liens on said property that secures said loan; causing a loan related search to be conducted, wherein the loan related search includes a search of both borrower related information and property related information; causing a report to be generated based upon the loan related search; and associating the loan with the insurance policy if the loan is approved. The invention may further include requiring the lender to obtain a completed application from the borrower along with borrower supplied information regarding any encumbrances known or suspected by the borrower; having the lender compare the report, the borrower's application, and the borrower supplied information to verify a lien position of the lender when making the loan; and having the lender ensure that all outstanding encumbrances on said property are subordinated to a new mortgage for the loan.
