PARSER FOR GENERATING FINANCIAL MANAGER APPLICATION RULES . In one embodiment, one or more business rules are received from a calculation manager. A calculation manager allows a user to generate the rules using a graphical format. The business rules are generated in a mark-up language, such as extensible mark-up language (XML). Data for the one or more business rules is loaded into a data structure for parsing. Data for the nodes may be read in by a token parser. When the token parser encounters a token, a business decision is determined. The token parser analyzes the data for the node to determine how to convert it to a business rule for the financial manager. This process continues as nodes are read in and with each token that is encountered, a business decision is determined until the rule for the financial manager is generated.
