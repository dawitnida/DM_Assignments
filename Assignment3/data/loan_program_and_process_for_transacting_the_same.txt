LOAN PROGRAM AND PROCESS FOR TRANSACTING THE SAME . A loan program and process is structured to provide a significant end-to-end cost savings while overcoming many, if not all, of the drawbacks and regulatory obstacles present in the current payday loan industry. The program, the end-to-end process, and the arrangement thereof, permits a lender to offer short-term, small cash loans to employees through an employer controlled payroll system. Access to the employer controlled payroll system is achieved through an agreed upon relationship between a coordinator, a lender, and the employer. As part of the agreed upon relationship, the lender guarantees that all fees, interest, and other ancillary costs over and above a principle amount of the short-term, small cash loan will be kept at or below a predetermined annual percentage rate (APR). In addition, the loan is repayable over a number of payroll cycles such that each successive payday the principle balance of the loan decreases.
