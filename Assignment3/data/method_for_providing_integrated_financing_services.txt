Method for providing integrated financing services . An integrated financing services method provides a leasing service for vendors accessible through the Internet, embedding financing into the checkout process using several Web services. The present service is accessed by a vendor to provide leasing prices on a line item by line item basis within an electronic shopping catalog. Depending on the detail provided by the sales company in the request for those rates, these lease prices can map to the specificity of the catalog. If the sales company has a catalog designed for a specific customer or industry, the lease prices provided can be tailored to those specifications as well. The present service allows the vendors to integrate leasing into their sales agents' and customers' shopping experience without a large investment in a flexible, and customer-customizable way. The lessor can now support vendors and customers in a very repeatable manner, using the same technology with no new special development for each vendor.
