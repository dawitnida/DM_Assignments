Tip-calculating device with a single tip-computation activation key . A tip-calculating device with a single tip-computation activation key is proposed, which allows the user to quickly calculate for the amount of a tip that should be given to a service person in such places as restaurant based on the total amount of expense being charged. The proposed tip-calculating device is characterized in that, after the user completes the inputting of the total amount of expense through numeric keypad, he/she just needs to press one more key, called tip-computation activation key, to cause the tip-calculating device to display the result. Compared to the prior art, since it requires the pressing of six more keys (which include multiplication key, numeric keys for the tip rate, and equal key) after the user completes the inputting of the total amount of expense, the tip-calculating device is undoubtedly more efficient and less time-wasting than the prior art.
