SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING APPRAISALS . A system and method for facilitating appraisals is disclosed. A lender and/or customer may request an appraisal from a hub. The hub checks the schedules of local appraisers, selects an appraiser and schedules the appraisal. Once the appraisal has been completed, the appraiser uploads the appraisal information and the hub transfers the information to the requester or other customer. The hub may also store the appraisal and information about the uploaded appraisal for analysis regarding the appraised property or the appraiser's work product.
