RESTRICTING ACCESS TO COMPROMISED ACCOUNT INFORMATION . A notification service protects different user accounts from being exposed to fraudulent activity when one of the accounts is compromised. The notification service instructs an issuer of the compromised account to automatically close, freeze or place the other associated accounts on a watch list to prevent potential exposure to the other accounts due to a security breach associated with the compromised account. The card holder may receive notification of the compromised account from the notification service or the issuer via a mobile device. The mobile device may directly contact other issuers with one request to restrict access to any accounts associated with the compromised account. In the event that the compromised account is loaded on the mobile device, the account is cancelled and a new account is loaded to the mobile device.
