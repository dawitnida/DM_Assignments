System and method for two-pass regulatory compliance . An automated system and method for ensuring that information in the form of data files provided by highly regulated businesses, such as financial institutions, comply with the most currently applicable Federal, state and local laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by applying a set of computer-encoded compliance rules to the transaction data files from these businesses in a two-pass regulatory compliance review methodology. In a first pass, a limited set of input data elements from one or more input transaction data files is used that results in an extremum or worst-case condition for compliance assessment by using one or more compliance rule sets. The transaction data files that are found to be not in compliance when using this limited set of data elements may or may not be in compliance when using a more complete and detailed set of data elements in a second pass.
