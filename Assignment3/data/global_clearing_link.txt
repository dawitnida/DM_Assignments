Global clearing link . The present invention relates to a clearing link connecting a plurality of clearing houses for clearing and settling transactions stemming form a trading platform. The clearing link processes transaction data stemming from the trading platform to be forwarded to individual clearing houses. The clearing house(s) are selected based on a transaction data analysis and predefined forward conditions. A trade member is thus able to select a clearing house not directly linked to the market of the trade member.
