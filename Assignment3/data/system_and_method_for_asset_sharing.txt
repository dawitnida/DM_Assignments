System and method for asset sharing . The present invention provides for private coordination of the borrowing of items from an aggregate inventory contributed by system participants. A request is received from a system participant. The request is compared with item information associated with a universe of items maintained by the system to determine if a match for the requested title exists. If the requested item exists, a determination is made whether the item is available, whether the item owner is willing to lend it to the system participant and the relative priority of the request compared to other participant requests for the item. If approval is received, transportation of the item to the intended recipient is coordinated. The status of the item is monitored during the lending process to ensure efficient sharing of the item.
