Non-capitalization weighted stock market index and index fund or funds . A method for the construction of a new type of stock market index, and stock market index fund, or funds where the index is constructed based upon the fundamental realities of the companies contained within the index rather than on the price, or market capitalization of the companies contained with the index. This fundamental data may include items such as the relative size of a collection of company's profits or assets or any fundamental accounting data contained within a standard U.S. GAAP company annual report and accounts.
