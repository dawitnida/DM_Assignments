Home Registry with Advertiser Contributions . Systems and methods assist a potential home buyer in funding a down payment for a residence, by accumulating contributions towards the down payment at least in part as a first function of purchases made through a first business, and keeping track of the contributions. All suitable interfaces are contemplated including especially electronic web page interfaces. Contributions can include cash, but also other suitable types, including for example points, and discounts. The purchases used as a basis for making contributions can be made by the potential home buyer, or by other person or entity. In especially preferred embodiments, a commercial lender, relative, builder, a builder's agent, or other third party can match some or all of the contributions. At least one of the contributions can be returned to a donor if the down payment is not used to purchase the residence during a given period of time.
