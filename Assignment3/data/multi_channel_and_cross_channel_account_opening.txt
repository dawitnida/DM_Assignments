Multi-Channel and Cross-Channel Account Opening . Embodiments as described herein include methods and a system for multi-channel and cross-channel account opening. An applicant may start an account opening process in one channel and move to one or more other channels without any application data being lost. A financial management system (FMS) provides a single account opening platform for multiple financial institutions (FIs) such that an application to open an account is handled by the FMS platform using shared resources among channels, and applying rules specified by each FI.
