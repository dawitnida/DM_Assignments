SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING A SECURED FINANCIAL TRANSACTION USING AN ALTERNATE SHIPPING ADDRESS . The disclosed system enables merchants to ship products to a predefined address that may or may not be an account holder's billing address. The account holder may define one or more alias identifiers that correspond to a predefined shipping address. The predefined shipping address is stored with a corresponding alias identifier. A merchant order form includes a field to accept an alias identifier, such that when the order form is submitted to the merchant and the merchant prepares a purchase authorization request, the alias identifier is included in the request. The credit account issuer receives the payment authorization request and extracts the alias identifier, which is used to locate a matching stored alias identifier. A shipping address corresponding to the stored alias identifier is retrieved and returned to the merchant with an authorization message.
