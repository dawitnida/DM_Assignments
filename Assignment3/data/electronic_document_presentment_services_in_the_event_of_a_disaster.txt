Electronic document presentment services in the event of a disaster . The disaster recovery techniques, for presentment of a company's bills, statements or the like, provide electronic document presentment in the event of a disaster that impacts the company's print mail delivery operation or other existing mailing system(s). Files containing electronic documents are received, from a system associated with the print mail delivery operation, and the documents are stored in a database. Preferably, the systems use the company's existing data files. The files may be converted to a format compatible with one or more electronic delivery methodologies, if necessary. The disaster recovery systems present notice and/or data from the documents to the company's customers electronically, for example as e-mail (notice or message containing some or all of the document data), as a document attachment to an e-mail, via a web site, and possibly via telephone voice announcement.
