Account With Easily Interchangeable Features . An account, such as a checking account or other instrument, is provided having a number of interchangeable features. The customer is given a choice of a number of available features such that a tailored account is created. Further, in a preferred embodiment the features are divided into standard and premium features of which the customer can choose a select number of each upon opening the account. The customer can thereafter change and interchange the features as needed, at no cost, and in real time as often as desired, such that as the customer's life or conditions change the account is always tailor-fit to the customer's needs. Further, additional features can be added to the account at an additional cost to the customer. Changes in features can be made with no need to close an account and then open a substitute account and at no cost to the customer.
