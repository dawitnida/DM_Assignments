System and method for business to investor exchange for raising capital and for creating a secondary market for private equity .

Sellers who subscribe to the system receive notice of the bid and can then respond. In a typical seller-driven transaction using the present invention, a seller puts out a notice on the system of equities for sale. Buyers who subscribe to the system receive notice and can respond. Either the buyer or the seller may be charged by the system, depending on the transaction."
