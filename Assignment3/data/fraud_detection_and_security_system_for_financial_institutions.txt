Fraud detection and security system for financial institutions . A fraud detection and security system for financial institutions utilizes a secure database of information relating to financial transactions of non-account holders who present checks and other instruments for payment. The system collects and tracks the frequency of particular aspects of the subject's behavior, and flags deviations from such norms for the purpose of indicating that fraudulent or criminal behavior may be occurring. At such time, the teller or other employee with whom the subject is dealing may stop the transaction, to the benefit of the financial institution and account holder. The system also allows for law enforcement to detect related transactions, or a string of criminal activity from the same perpetrator. In the preferred mode, the system includes a teller collecting information from the non-account holder, including name, date of birth, address, gender, driver's license number, social security number, and/or telephone number. At the time of the transaction, such data is submitted to the system database and the database returns a response code based upon criteria established by the financial institution's desired security measures, accomplished by installation of new software or by integration of a custom program. The system alerts tellers to suspicious activity, such as when a particular account is accessed more than once in a day, or when the same non-account holder presents items for payment at multiple branches of a banking institution in a short period of time.
