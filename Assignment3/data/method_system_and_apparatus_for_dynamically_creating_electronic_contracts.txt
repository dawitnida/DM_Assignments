METHOD, SYSTEM, AND APPARATUS FOR DYNAMICALLY CREATING ELECTRONIC CONTRACTS . A method of dynamically negotiating a transaction can include determining a potential transaction between participants according to transaction parameters stored within a transaction parameter data store. The transaction parameters can be associated with each of the participants and can specify acceptable transaction terms. The potential transactions can be evaluated according to a mutual benefit conferred on the participants by the potential transactions according to the transaction parameters. The potential transactions can be ordered according to decreasing mutual benefit; and, the potential transaction having the greatest mutual benefit can be presented to the participants.
