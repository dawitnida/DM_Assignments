METHOD AND SYSTEM TO RE-CREATE LOST CASH LETTERS . A method and system to re-create lost cash letters are disclosed. Embodiments of the invention can be used to re-create a paper-based cash letter or an electronic cash letter file that is inadvertently lost due a system failure, theft, natural disaster, or the like. The items represented in the cash letter are identified and a file corresponding to a data set describing the plurality of items is created. Images representing the plurality of items are stored within a recovery check image management system (CIMS). The file corresponding to the data set can then be reformatted using the images in order to re-create the cash letter. Finally, the cash letter can be presented with at least one of an image and an image replacement document (IRD) for each item of the plurality of items in the recovery CIMS.
