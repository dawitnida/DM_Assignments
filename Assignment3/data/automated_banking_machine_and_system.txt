Automated banking machine and system . An automated banking machine includes at least one browser and transaction function devices, including a currency dispenser device. The machine can be operated in a modified mode in response to transactions that are no longer available. A browser can be used to communicate with one or more servers. Data indicative of the availability of the certain transaction function devices can be communicated to a server. One or more mark up language documents containing data and/or instructions that correspond to the operational availability to the machine of the transaction function devices can be accessed. The machine can then be operated responsive to the data and/or instructions. For example, the machine may change its display output to a customer to reflect its current transaction function device status. Customer transaction options can be readily changed via machine/server communication on a machine by machine basis.
