Systems and methods for remarketable fixed income securities . A straight debt security may include a maturity component, a reset component, and a remarketing component. In general, the maturity component provides a maturity term of the straight debt security. The reset component specifies the terms and conditions for resetting a yield on the straight debt security. The remarketing component provides terms and conditions for remarketing the straight debt security to new investors. After remarketing, the straight debt security remains outstanding and potential recapture of excess tax benefits is postponed until the straight debt security ceases to be outstanding.
