FRAUD PREVENTION AND REPLACEMENT OF CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS - LOST, STOLEN, DEFECTIVE OR FRAUDULENTLY USED . "A credit card security system method for preventing fraudulent use, comprising the steps of a credit card provider opening one account with two different card numbers, with a first ""main credit card"" and a second credit card for a spare. The main credit card is activated by the provider and the spare credit card remains ""deactivated"". On a pre-set time basis the credit card provider will automatically upon notice to the customer, deactivate the main card and activate the spare card. If any suspicious or fraudulent transaction is detected by the credit card provider, the main credit card is deactivated. If the transaction is authorized, then the main credit card is re-activated. If the transaction is not authorized, the spare credit card is activated to be used as the main credit card. The credit card provider then replaces the deactivated credit card with a new number and sends a new credit card with the new credit card remaining deactivated."
