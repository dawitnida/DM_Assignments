Method for standardizing reporting of issues, assumptions, and risks for a risk review board . A method, system, and computer program product for standardizing reporting of issues, assumptions, and risks for a risk review board is provided. In one embodiment, a risk management tool presents a user with a form for entering information about a risk management unit, such as, for example, a risk, assumption, issue, or risk plan. The risk management tool then receives information about the risk management unit from the user through the form. The form provides the user with entry areas for every element needed to properly adhere to a risk management scheme for the particular risk management unit. Furthermore, the user is hindered or prevented from exiting the form prior to supplying all information necessary for adherence to the risk management scheme. Thus, the risk management tool increases the likelihood that risk managers adhere to a risk management scheme, thus minimizing the occurrence of identified risks.
