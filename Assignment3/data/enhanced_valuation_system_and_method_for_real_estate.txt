Enhanced Valuation System and Method for Real Estate . A system and method for producing a valuation for real property that allows the rating of various metrics that contribute to a determination of value for the subject property, the rating being based on the quality and applicability to the subject property of the data sources from which data is gathered for each metric, such that the final valuation is based on a weighted average of each of the metrics, thereby eliminating the human bias from the actual valuation result, but providing an improved result over a valuation based solely on results from an automated valuation model.
