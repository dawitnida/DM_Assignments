Network reverse auction and spending analysis methods . A computer-implemented telecommunications spending analysis system extracts telecommunications traffic detail data from billing statements provided by telecommunications carriers and converts the traffic detail data to a generic data format for aggregation in a uniform customer traffic history database. The spending analysis system compares billed rates against estimated market prices stored in a best of class (BOC) database and notifies the user of possible cost savings attainable in a renegotiated contract. A web-based RFP system facilitates preparation of a request for proposals (RFP) and solicitation of vendors to bid on the RFP in an online reverse auction environment, both for telecommunications services and other commodities. The RFP system may access the uniform customer traffic history database to facilitate preparation of a traffic forecast of the RFP. Upon completion of an RFP auction, the RFP system updates the estimated market prices of the BOC database based on the vendor bids.
