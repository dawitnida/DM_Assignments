Non-textual representation of access activities regarding a resource . Techniques are disclosed to present an authorized user of a resource with a non-textual representation of characteristics regarding a historical record of access attempts to the resource while the authorized user accessing the resource. Such techniques may be further enhanced by providing the capability to notify an investigatory entity of undesired access attempts or by premising the presentation of such a non-textual representation upon the authentication of the authorized user. The presentation of the non-textual representation may be configured by the authorized user and may also be premised upon reaching a certain threshold of undesired access attempts. Such techniques may utilize a user interface subsystem that interacts with a access management subsystem.
