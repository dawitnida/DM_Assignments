Method for recapitalization of debit by companies under financial stress . Methods of recapitalizing a corporation or nation's obligations including reorganizing the principal owed on maturity and interest rate and period of a single class of Base Security and creating a Companion Security or an option. In one method, the Companion Security or option offers an increased payment of income and a decreased principal owed on maturity when compared to the Base Security. The holders of the Base Security are then offered the right to exchange the Base Security for the Companion Security or option, thereby terminating the corporation's obligations. Alternatively, a call option is offered from a holder of the Base Security to the corporation where the corporation has the right to repurchase the Base Security at less than the principal originally owed at maturity with the right to specify a different time than the original maturity or an agreement to make future payments tracking the interest payment period of the Base Security.
