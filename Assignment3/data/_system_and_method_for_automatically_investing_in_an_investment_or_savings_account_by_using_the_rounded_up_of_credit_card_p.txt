"System and method for automatically investing in an investment or savings account by using the ""rounded up"" of credit card purchase amounts to produce savings/investment amounts ". A central computer includes data input means, data processing means and data storage means and is used by a credit card issuer for automatically funding an investment for the credit card holder. A rounded-up numerical figure selected by the cardholder is stored in the memory of the computer. The computer maintains a record of the purchase or advance amount each time the cardholder uses the creditcard. The data processing means determines, with reference to the rounded-up numerical figure, a rounded amount which is in excess of the purchase or advance amount. The data processing means also determines a savings amount (which is periodically transferred to the investment account) by subtracting the purchase or advance amount from the rounded amount.
