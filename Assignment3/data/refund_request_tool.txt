REFUND REQUEST TOOL . A business may uniformly calculate and offer a fee refund to customers requesting refunds for fees charged to the customers' accounts. Rather than relying on individual employee discretion, a server may use account information and customer information to generate the fee refund amount to be offered to the customer. The calculated refund amount may be based on a variety of considerations including, but not limited to, the amount the account is overdrawn, the profitability of the account, the number of occurrences of charged fees, and/or other factors such as family relationships to other bank customers. Additionally, a fee refund offer may be stored and referred to when the customer subsequently requests a refund.
