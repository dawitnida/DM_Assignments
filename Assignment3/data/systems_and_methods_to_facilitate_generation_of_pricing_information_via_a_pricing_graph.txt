Systems and methods to facilitate generation of pricing information via a pricing graph . Systems and methods are provided to facilitate generation of pricing information. According to one embodiment, a pricing graph having a plurality of inter-dependent nodes is constructed. The pricing graph includes at least one input pricing information node and output pricing information node. In addition, at least one node provides information that effects information received by that node. A frame is established with at least one input pricing information slot and output pricing information slot. The pricing graph is then executed via a pricing engine in substantially real time. As a result, a value in the input pricing information slot is provided to the input pricing information node and a value for the output pricing information slot is received from the output pricing information node.
