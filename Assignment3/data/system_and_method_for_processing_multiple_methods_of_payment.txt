System and Method For Processing Multiple Methods of Payment . Financial transaction data comprising payment on any one of multiple financial transaction types are processed with an adapter layer that receives an incoming data message relating to a financial transaction initiated by a payer and operates on the incoming data message to produce adapted data relating to the financial transaction, and a processor that receives the adapted data and determines transaction routing to direct the adapted data to a processing network module that requests authorization by an issuer, responds to authorization by initiating request for settlement and payment on the financial transaction to a transaction payee, and responds to payee query requests by providing non-payment data to an external payee.
