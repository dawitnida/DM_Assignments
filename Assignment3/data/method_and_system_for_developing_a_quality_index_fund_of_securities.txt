Each candidate security may have a quality rating that meets or exceeds a rating threshold. A dividend payment for each candidate security may be accessed. A computer-generated rank may be automatically assigned to each of the candidate securities. The rank may be based on the dividend payment for each candidate security. The candidate securities may be ranked from highest to lowest. A subset may be selected including the highest ranked candidate securities. A computer-generated weight for each security in the subset may be determined by dividing the dividend payment for each security by a total dividend payment for all of the securities in the subset. An index fund may be created including the weighted securities.
