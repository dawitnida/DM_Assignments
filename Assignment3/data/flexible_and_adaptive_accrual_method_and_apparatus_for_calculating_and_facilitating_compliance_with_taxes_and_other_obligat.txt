FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTIVE ACCRUAL METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CALCULATING AND FACILITATING COMPLIANCE WITH TAXES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS . A computer-based system and method calculates and facilitates revenue accrual, for making larger, less frequent payments of estimated taxes or other obligations. Payer preferences are applied to satisfy variable payment intervals, amounts, and available resources. The obligation, required payments, and set-aside schedules are recalculated as needed, under payer and/or system control. Excess accruals are minimized; set-aside schedules are configurable. The system may be self-contained, handheld, or accessed remotely. Automatic datalinks move information and command fund transfers from the payer's bank, to accrue funds and make payments to other accounts. A service host may support a plurality of payers to make set-asides and payments at various levels as needed, on an individual or batch basis, including individual taxpayer enrollment for batch file tax payments by service providers. Some embodiments can be embedded to enhance the capabilities of other systems.
