Mapping total return to shareholder . Software encoded on a computer-readable medium when executed performs a method for assessing the performance of a company. The method includes receiving financial data about the company; calculating a Total Economic Profit (TEP) value based in part on the financial data, the TEP value including a current value component and a future value component, determining at least one business component of the company that drives at least one selected from the group comprising the current value component and the future value component, and assessing the at least one business component based in part on at least one selected from the group comprising the TEP value, the current value component, and the future value component. From this data, a Total Return to Shareholders (TRS) value may be calculated with a data processor. The TRS may be decomposed into components and mapped onto a computer-generated display. The data may also be incorporated in corporate management systems and investment analysis systems.
