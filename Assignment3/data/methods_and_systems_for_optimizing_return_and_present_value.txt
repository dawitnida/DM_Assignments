Methods and systems for optimizing return and present value . A method of valuation of large groups of assets by partial full underwriting, partial sample underwriting and inferred values of the remainder using an iterative and adaptive statistical evaluation of all assets and statistical inferences drawn from the evaluation and applied to generate inferred values. Individual asset values are developed and listed in tables so that individual asset values can be taken and quickly grouped in any desired or prescribed manner for bidding purposes. The assets are collected into a database, divided by credit variable, subdivided by ratings as to those variables and then rated individually. The assets are then regrouped according to a bidding grouping and a collective valuation established by cumulating the individual valuations.
