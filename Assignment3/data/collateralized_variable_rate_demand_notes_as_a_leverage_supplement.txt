Collateralized variable rate demand notes as a leverage supplement . A financial process and method of leveraging certain financing instruments is disclosed that includes a deployment of the CVRDN financial instrument specifically within the venture capital and investment banking market sector. A CVRDN Series is issued in such a way as to create leveraged returns. The CVRDN Series enables increased gains while simultaneously limiting leveraged risk/exposure. The proceeds from the CVRDNs are placed on deposit in a reserve account in such manner as to create the potential for a positive arbitrage of those funds that is sufficient to fully offset CVRDN interest payable while investment opportunities are being identified. The CVRDN Proceeds are deployed with a selection of credit underwriters that are willing to issue Principal Letters of Credit as the basis to support the creation of certain leverage of associated equity-based investment proceeds.
