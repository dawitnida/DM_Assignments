MOBILE APPLICATION MONITORING SYSTEM . A method and system to test, monitor, and share revenue associated with third-party software applications operating on mobile devices over a network operator's wireless network. An application may be tested by the mobile application monitoring system to simulate the expected load of the application on a mobile device and the wireless network utilized by the mobile device, and to determine any services utilized by the application. Based on the simulation, the system determines a compensation arrangement under which revenue associated with the application will be shared between the network operator and the application provider. In some embodiments, the compensation arrangement is determined from a variable reward table. Revenue is shared inversely with an application's impact on customers and on the network operator.
