Methods and systems for identifying attributable errors in financial processes . A method and system for statistically analyzing financial databases to identify special causes responsible for systematic variances is disclosed. Financial data are obtained from any compiled source and compared against either other members of the data set or to externally provided financial controls. Computed data means and variances are used to characterize the behavior of individual data sets with respect to expected means. Statistically significant variances from the anticipated behavior of the data set form the basis for follow-up multivariate and survival analysis of the data to identify statistically significant financial factors (special causes) contributing to the variances. Identification of the financial factors responsible for the variances in the data provide the means by which process changes are designed, implemented and monitored over time to minimize subsequent variances in the compiled data set.
