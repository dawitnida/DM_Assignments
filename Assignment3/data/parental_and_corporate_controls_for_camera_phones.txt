Parental and corporate controls for camera-phones . A system and method of the present invention provide parental and corporate control for a camera-phone. An administration authority web site is provided that enables an owner of a camera-phone to log into a server and establish a set of control policies that specify what actions on the phone are authorized for what user. The control policies that affect behavior of the camera-phone are downloaded to the camera-phone, and the camera-phone is then operated such that a user of the camera-phone is only able to perform actions authorized by the control policies. In a further embodiment, a control policy is provided that requires the camera-phone to upload captured images to the server for review by the camera-phone owner. In addition, the images may be quarantined until the camera-phone owner authorizes their release to the user.
