Programmed assessment of technological, legal and management risks . Potential risk exposures of an organization's activities in new and evolving areas where historical data is not available, are assessed using a programmed technique and expert algorithm. A questionnaire prompts for answers that must be selected from a limited quantifiable set, or alternatively will default to a high risk assessment. The answers are scored using an algorithm that computes potential risk levels using stored data and expert rules. A report is generated containing information identifying potential risk levels and preferably contains recommendations selected as a function of the answers or the assessed risks. The responses and report are stored to be used for comparative purposes in future assessments. The technique is useful in assessing risks, although the new and evolving activity may not be well understood or characterized by a data store of experience in similar claims. The technique is useful to build a data store while simultaneously helping to control losses by educating businesses as to their vulnerabilities.
