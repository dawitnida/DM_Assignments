ENHANCED CHECK 21 FINANCIAL PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND METHODS . The present invention provides a digitally originated check (DOC) through an electronic payment system (EPS) which captures payor metadata instructions regarding the intended payment to a payee. The metadata is stored in a database or the like for further processing instead of printing a paper check. The DOC can be cleared either electronically or through a paper substitute check through Check 21 clearing methods. The present invention further provides a true check card operable to provide DOCs at point-of-sale terminals.
