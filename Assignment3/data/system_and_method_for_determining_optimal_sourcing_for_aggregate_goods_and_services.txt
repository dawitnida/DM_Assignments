System and method for determining optimal sourcing for aggregate goods and services . A method of allowing shoppers to compare prices from different vendors includes receiving a shopping list of goods and/or services from the user. The best available price for each item or service on the shopping list is determined, and is displayed to the user. A best available aggregate price for the items as a group is found from a merchant who offers all of the items or services for sale, and the aggregate price is displayed for the user. The user can directly see price differences between purchasing the items individually versus purchasing the items in aggregate from a single merchant. A system for allowing a user to compare purchasing options include an input section which allows a user to specify a list of items for possible purchase. A processing section is provided for determining best available individual prices for the items if purchased separately from different merchants, and for determining a single aggregate price if the items are purchased together from a single merchant. A first display section is provided for displaying the best available individual prices, and a second display section is provided for displaying the single aggregate price.
