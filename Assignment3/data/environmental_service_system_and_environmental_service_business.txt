Environmental service system and environmental service business . An environmental service business-entity designs at least one of a unit for heating a space or target space higher than an outside-air temperature and a unit for cooling the target space lower than an outside-air temperature, the target space having been defined between the business-entity and a client. The business-entity guarantees that the quality of environment including the temperature of the target space will be maintained in a range determined in consultation with the client. This condition substantially guarantees the total cost that results from assessing both an initial cost and a running cost. Accordingly, the user finds it easier to introduce an environmental facility without risk.
