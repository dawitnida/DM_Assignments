SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CLASSIFYING A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION AS A RECURRING FINANCIAL TRANSACTION . A system that automatically classifies a financial transaction as a recurring financial transaction based on classification data obtained from a set of users is presented. The system can also determine the frequency at which the recurring financial transaction repeats. If the financial transaction is classified as a recurring financial transaction, the system can mark the financial transaction as a recurring financial transaction.
