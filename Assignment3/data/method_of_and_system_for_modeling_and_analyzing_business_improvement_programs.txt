Method of and system for modeling and analyzing business improvement programs . An automated system (100) and method for evaluating the probable impact of user-specified or system generated changes in business value drivers on the other value drivers, the elements of value, the real options, the financial performance and the future value of a commercial enterprise. Value drivers are identified using search algorithms and induction algorithms that define the value drivers associated with each element of the enterprise. After identifying enterprise value drivers the system completes a detailed valuation of the firm using predictive models to determine the relative impact of each value driver on the overall valuation. The detailed valuation results are then used to define a financial simulation model such as a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model. The financial simulation model then analyzes the impact of user specified changes in value drivers on financial performance or generates a list of recommended changes to value drivers that achieve a user specified financial goal.
