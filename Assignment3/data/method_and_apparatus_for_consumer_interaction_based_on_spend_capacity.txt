METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONSUMER INTERACTION BASED ON SPEND CAPACITY . "Share of Wallet (""SoW"") is a modeling approach that utilizes various data sources to provide outputs that describe a consumer's spending capability, tradeline history including balance transfers, and balance information. These outputs can be appended to data profiles of customers and prospects and can be utilized to support decisions involving prospecting, new applicant evaluation, and customer management across the lifecycle. In addition to credit card companies, SoW outputs may be useful to companies issuing, for example: private label cards, life insurance, on-line brokerages, mutual funds, car sales/leases, hospitals, and home equity lines of credit or loans. ""Best customer"" models can correlate SoW outputs with various customer groups. A SoW score focusing on a consumer's spending capacity can be used in the same manner as a credit bureau score."
