Investment Method for Incentivizing Economic Development . A method for managing an account to produce tax money for the benefit of a sponsoring entity and a designated beneficiary entity. A beneficiary account is designated into which an owner of an original corpus of funds transfers such funds. The beneficiary account produces a growth and/or income to which no or a reduced or deferred rate of first taxation is applied. A second tax is periodically assessed against all or part of the original corpus of funds. The second tax may be paid to the sponsoring entity or the beneficiary entity or split between both entities.
