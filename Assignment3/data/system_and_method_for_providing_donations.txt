System and method for providing donations . A donation certificate and redemption system allows a donor to generate donation certificates that can be used by the donor or gifted to redeemers. The donation certificate includes a donation amount and a list of charities that can be selected by the redeemer. At redemption of the donation certificate, the redeemer nominates the charity and initiates a transfer of the donation amount, either from a donor account or a holding account, to an account of the nominated charity.
