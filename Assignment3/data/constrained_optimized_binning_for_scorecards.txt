Constrained Optimized Binning For Scorecards . Computer-implemented systems and methods are provided for generating bins for a scorecard. An approximate set of bins is generated by applying an optimization model to binning data. The optimization model includes an objective function, constraints, and surrogate weight of evidence metric(s). The approximated set of bins are then used in scorecard operations.
