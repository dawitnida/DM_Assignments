Method of providing financial accounting compliance . The present invention discloses a method of establishing an internal control framework that ensures accurate financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxlet Act of 2002. The method provided utilizes the established business processes to identify risks, determine the necessary controls to be implemented to mitigate these risks in order to ensure that financial assertions, and as a result, accounts, are accurate. Following this process thereby reduces costs associated with audits and compliance with the new accounting rules when compared to other publicly known methods of compliance.
