Homeowners Housing Price Protection Program Against Selling Losses . "The product protects the value of a ""for sale"" home against a falling real estate market. A hedge against fluctuating home prices is created by purchasing a hedge insurance ""Policy."" The home is appraised, by a certified appraiser, when the ""Policy"" is issued. The ""Policy"" guarantees, that the appraised value of the home will be paid, under certain conditions, if the home sells while the policy is in effect. The home is reappraised at the time of the sale to establish a fair value, and if the homeowner. received less than original appraisal, the ""Policy"" pays the difference of the reappraised value or the sales price, whichever was greater."
