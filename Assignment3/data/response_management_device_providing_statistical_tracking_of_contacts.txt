Response management device providing statistical tracking of contacts . The present invention teaches that financial services, in particular mortgage lending/brokerage services may be offered on-line via a consumer contact management system which collects statistical data on the contact process and impels faster responses on the part of mortgage professional teams. In particular, when a consumer provides a contact to a financial team, the information provided is mediated by a central computer system/server/site and divided into specific contact information and general financial information. The central system then forwards the general financial information to the team but withholds the specific contact information until the professional responds, at which time specific contact information is provided. Statistics on response effectiveness, timeliness, comparative data, and raw numbers may be gathered and analyzed by this means.
