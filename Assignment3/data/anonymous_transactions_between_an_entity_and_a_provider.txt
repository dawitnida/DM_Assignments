Anonymous transactions between an entity and a provider . An entity initiates a transaction with a provider by sending an entity identification to a first anonymity service. In response, the entity receives a transaction identification, based on and uniquely associated with the entity identification, from the first anonymity service. Thereafter, the entity initiates acquisition of goods associated with the transaction by sending an acquisition request and the transaction identification to a second anonymity service. In this manner, enhanced security and privacy is achieved.
