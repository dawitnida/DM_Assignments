System and method for linking gemstones and insurance . A supportable value product such as diamonds is guaranteed for an extended period of time so that an owner can return the product at any point over the guarantee period for a complete refund of the amount paid for the product. The products are covered by an insurance policy by a respected insurance carrier so that if the owner wishes to return the product, the total amount paid for the product is refunded. The insurance policy covers at most the retail price less the wholesale price paid to the seller. The products, for example gemstones such as diamonds, are characterized and identified with a unique identification before being mounted and sold via a store or through the television or internet. The merchant coordinates and controls interactions and data between various entities such that the products are quickly prepared and shipped to the customer and the entities are paid within a short period of time.
