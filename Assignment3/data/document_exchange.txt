Document exchange . In an e-commerce context, a method and system are provided for exchanging documents in transactions between partners. The partners are joined in an exchange network and are communicating with each other via a hub entity. The documents are transformed from one partner's native format to another partner's native format via an interim standard document to which a common process is applied. The common process applies partner-specific rules to the standard document.
