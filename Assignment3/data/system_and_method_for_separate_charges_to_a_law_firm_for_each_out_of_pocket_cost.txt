System and method for separate charges to a law firm for each out-of-pocket cost . A computerized method and system for the payment of out-of-pocket fees such as patent and trademark fees is disclosed. The patent or trademark fee for a client of a firm is charged against an account maintained by an organization separate from the firm. A charge issued at a workstation at the firm is delivered to a patent or patent and trademark agency, or a foreign associate firm, where it is cashed against an account maintained by the separate organization. The firm bills the client for the fee, along with a service charge, while the separate organization bills the firm for the fee and the service charge. Payment from the client to the firm for the fee and service charge is then sent to the separate organization to cover the firm's bill from the separate organization. A law firm maintains its own account and uses a second account funded with a loan to pay the out-of-pocket costs. According to one or more example embodiments of the inventive subject matter hereof, but not by limitation, there is provided method and apparatus providing for a third party to assist a law firm to pay a plurality of out-of-pocket costs for one or more clients, and the third party billing the law firm services rendered in connection with the separate charges.
