Toll road charge collection system using artificial satellite, charge collecting machine, and charge collecting method . A toll road charge collection system comprises a vehicle (7) having an on-vehicle machine (11, 130) mounted thereon, an artificial satellite (1), and a system data center (20). The on-vehicle machine (11, 130) receives radio signal from the artificial satellite (1), and calculates the latitude, the longitude, and the altitude as the vehicle position according to the received radio signal. Latitude data, longitude data, and altitude data indicating the traveling vehicle position history are stored in an external storage unit (46) as a time-series log file, and transmitted to the system data center (20), where the data are stored/accumulated in a storage unit (63) for each vehicle. In the system data center (20), a toll road section in which the vehicle (7) has traveled is determined according to the toll road path position data including the latitude data, the longitude data, and the altitude data indicating the traveling vehicle position history transmitted from the vehicle (7) and stored/accumulated in a database. The traveling charge is calculated for each person traveling on the toll road according to the traveling charge data specified for each route section, and the charge is collected by the automatic payment through an account of a financial institution (25) set by the toll road traveling person in advance.
