Systems and methods for validation of phone numbers . Systems and methods are described for determining whether a telephone number offered by a customer in conjunction with a proposed financial transaction is valid or non-valid in order to better evaluate the risk of participating in the transaction. In one embodiment, a telephone number validation system directs a point-of-sale device to accept a telephone number from a customer who is offering a promissory payment and to dial the telephone number in order to confirm that the telephone number is a working number prior to accepting the promissory payment. In one embodiment, a suitably configured device may dial a telephone number and may determine whether the telephone number is valid or non-valid based on a perceived tone that is emitted in response to the call.
