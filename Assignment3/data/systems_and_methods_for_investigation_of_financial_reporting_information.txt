Systems and methods for investigation of financial reporting information . Financial data including general ledger activity and underlying journal entries are examined to determine whether risks of material misstatement due to fraudulent financial reporting can be identified. The financial data is analyzed statistically and modeled over time, comparing actual data values with predicted data values to identify anomalies in the financial data. The anomalous financial data is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to identify common characteristics of the various transactions underlying the anomalies. The common characteristics are then compared with characteristics derived from data known to derive from fraudulent activity, and the common characteristics are reported, along with a weight or probability that the anomaly associated with the common characteristic is an identification of risks of material misstatement due to fraud. Large volumes of financial data are therefore efficiently processed to accurately identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud in connection with financial audits, or for actual detection of fraud in connection with forensic and investigative accounting activities. The analysis is enhanced by using flow analysis methods to select subsets of financial data to examine for anomalies. Flow analysis methods are also used to reveal useful business information found in money flow graphs of financial data.
