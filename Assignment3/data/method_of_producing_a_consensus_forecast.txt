Method of producing a consensus forecast . Methods are provided for producing a consensus forecast. An adjusted consensus forecast for a plurality of economic indicators is produced by compensating for forecasters who miss a monthly forecast and by adjusting for unchanged forecasts from the prior monthly survey and by compensating for a lack of dynamism in the forecast values. Where a forecaster misses a forecast, the missing forecast is replaced by the last submitted forecast, for up to three periods following the last submitted forecasts. Unchanged forecasts, whether naturally unchanged or generated by replacement forecasts, are adjusted by taking into account the rate of change of the consensus from the previous monthly survey.
