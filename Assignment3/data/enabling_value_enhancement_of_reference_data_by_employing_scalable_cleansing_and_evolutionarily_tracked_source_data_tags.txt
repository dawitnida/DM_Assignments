Enabling value enhancement of reference data by employing scalable cleansing and evolutionarily tracked source data tags . Provision for scalable cleansing and value enhancement of data in the context of a multi-source multi-tenant data repository. The source data comes from multiple sources and on multiple topics. Evolutionarily tracked source data tags are used to hold tracking information reflecting the nature and sources of each change to the data, as it is affected during the various stages of data processing. The stages of processing include validation, normalization, single-source cleansing and cross-source processes. Various rules are applied during these stages, and evolutionarily tracked source data tags are used to record sources and agents of all changes to the data. As information is processed, transformed, and added to the repository, corresponding evolutionarily tracked source data tags are stored in association with the various information elements. The information contained in these tags can be used to enforce data entitlements in a multi-tenant data repository environment.
