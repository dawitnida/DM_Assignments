The firm bills the client for the fee, along with a service charge, while the separate organization bills the firm for the fee and the service charge. According to one example embodiment of the inventive subject matter herein, there is provided method and apparatus including in one embodiment one or more computers programmed to receive data indicative of a plurality of out-of-pocket costs for one or more clients of a law firm and to determine a separate charge in relation to each respective out-of-pocket cost wherein the charge is determined at least in part based on a cost associated with financing the out-of-pocket costs.
