System and method for early detection and prevention of identity theft . A system and method for early detection of identity theft are provided. With the system and method an authorized user establishes an identity with an organization's computing system and registers both a mobile device and a notification device with the organization's computing system. When a use of the identity is attempted, a record associated with the identity is retrieved and a request is sent to the registered mobile device for location information. The current location of the mobile device is then compared to the location of the source of the request for authorization. If the current location of the mobile device is not within an area of the source of the authentication request, then information about the attempted use is compared with the registered notification criteria to determine if a notification should be sent to the notification device requesting authorization of the attempted use. If the conditions of the attempted use fall within one or more of the notification criteria, a notification message may be composed and sent to the notification device. The notification message allows an authorized user of the notification device to authorize use of the identity at the source location.
