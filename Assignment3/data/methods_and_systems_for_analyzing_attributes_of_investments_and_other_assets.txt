Methods and Systems for Analyzing Attributes of Investments and Other Assets . Investors find assistance with determining and/or evaluating relative positions of investments with respect to a variety of evaluation parameters and attributes obtained from a number of data sources.

In some cases, the graphical displays are accompanied by analytical comments that further explain or amplify the information being conveyed graphically.
