Heterogeneous Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure Management Orchestration . In certain embodiments, a method includes accessing one or more parameters based on an IT service request received from an upper-layer IT interface, the parameters formatted according to an upper-layer IT interface construct. Appropriate IT domains are determined, according to at least a portion of the parameters, from a number of IT domains for implementing IT infrastructure for fulfilling the request, the domains each associated with one or more vendor-specific solutions for providing IT infrastructure of a type associated with the domain. Using a common semantic interrelational data model that includes mappings of constructs for upper-layer IT interfaces to constructs for IT domains, at least a portion of the parameters are translated from the upper-layer IT interface construct into constructs suitable for use by the determined appropriate domains. One or more parameterized instructions operable to cause appropriate vendor-specific implementations of the determined appropriate domains to implement appropriate infrastructure for fulfilling the request are communicated.
