Method and Apparatus for Computer Assisted Settling of Debts . A method and apparatus is provided for consumers to receive the recent settlement histories of their creditors in a web-hosted application that drives the settlement process, so they can use this insider knowledge to settle their debts for cents-on-the-dollar. One embodiment provides a computer assisted tool that tells consumers what their creditors take to settle debts for cents-on-the-dollar, and equips consumers to conduct the settlement process using a turn-key, web-hosted application; or alternatively provides a full-service embodiment that allows consumers to get immediate relief from collectors and be debt free in a matter of months rather than decades. The invention thus provides debtors with at least two principal competitive advantages: it provides debtors with knowledge in advance concerning how much credit card companies may take to settle their debts in view of their financial hardships; and it provides consumers with a turn-key method to settle their debts at discounts equivalent to those that professional negotiators could achieve.
