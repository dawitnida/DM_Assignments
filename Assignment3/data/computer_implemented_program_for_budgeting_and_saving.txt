Computer-implemented program for budgeting and saving . A web-based system for budgeting and saving by a client using a team approach. In an example embodiment, the system is configured for client homebuyers to collaborate with third parties such as financial counselors and real estate agents. The clients select third parties to their teams, and a team connect component enables the team members to exchange messages in real time. Based on their collaborative role, the third parties are assigned a class permission that sets their access to the client's information. A collaboration module permits the client to navigate through the website with the client-selected screens also displayed to the third parties, provided they have the required class permission for the displayed information. The reports are sortable by field and configured so the third parties can select one or more clients from the reports and use the team connect component to communicate with all the selected clients simultaneously.
