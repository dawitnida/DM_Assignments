Credit Proxy System and Method . A system and method of providing to a consumer or other debtor protection against use of the debtor's identity to establish credit using an intermediary that is adapted to communicate with both the debtor and a potential credit grantor. There is a registration process in which the debtor registers with the intermediary; the registration includes user identification information and a level of protection that is authorized by the debtor on new credit. A credit grantor clearance process follows, in which a credit grantor that has been asked to extend credit to the debtor clears the request with the intermediary before issuing the new credit.
