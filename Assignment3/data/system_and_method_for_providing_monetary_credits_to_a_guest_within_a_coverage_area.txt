System and method for providing monetary credits to a guest within a coverage area . A system and method for providing monetary credits to guests at a coverage area. The system includes a service or kiosk system having an RFID reader, an input device, a network interface, and a processor, and a central server having a network interface, a non-volatile memory, and a processor. A guest pays for a desired amount of monetary credits and that information is entered into the service or kiosk system. A tag identifier is entered into the service or kiosk system by an RFID reader reading the identifier from a guest's RFID tag. The service or kiosk system processor causes the transmission of the tag identifier and amount of monetary credits information to the central server. The central server processor then accesses a guest data object from the non-volatile memory, and modifies a monetary credits field of the guest data object based on the amount of monetary credits purchased.
