REJECTED CHECKS ENVELOPE AND PROCESS . Embodiments of the invention provide apparatuses and methods for processing rejected checks. Checks that are rejected for deposit at deposit locations are captured on-site. A carrier picking up the rejected checks at the deposit location sorts the rejected checks into envelopes with data recognition markings. The recognition markings on the envelopes help with sorting and identifying the checks as rejected, as well as providing data to associate the rejected checks with a customer or an account. Image files are created for the rejected checks using an image capture system. Data files are created to match-up with the image files. The rejected checks are investigated to populate the data file, in order to determine how to process the rejected checks. The checks are submitted for posting and settlement often before any claims are made by customers for provisional funds for their rejected checks.
