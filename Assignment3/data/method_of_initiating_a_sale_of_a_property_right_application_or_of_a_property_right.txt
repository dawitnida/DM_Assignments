Method of initiating a sale of a property right application or of a property right . The invention relates to a method of initiating a sale of a property right application or of a property right by a data processing device (4). For this purpose, the data processing device (4) receives from an offering party (X) a code of a property right application that is for sale or of a property right that is for sale, the property right application or the property right being clearly identifiable by the code. Subsequently, the data processing device (4) identifies a property right application of interest or a property right of interest on the basis of at least one criterion. Alternatively, the data processing device (4) additionally finds a party (K2, K3) potentially interested in buying the property right application or the property right, so that a contact between the offering party (X) or seller (X) and the potential buyer (K2, K3) can be established.
