Method of compensating employees using stock equity . This invention comprises a method for defining, establishing and operating a business model, or an augmentation to a business model, that uses a grant of a portion of the equity of a startup company as a component in a deal with a professional service company such as a consulting company. The present invention includes the grant of a portion of the equity in a startup company that serves at least three unique, simultaneous purposes: (1) as inducement to the professional services company to participate in assisting or otherwise supporting the startup; (2) as a cost free component to the professional services company, a portion of which (for example, 50%), is then allocated as a payment budget to the various employee's or agents of the professional services company if and only if they perform work for the startup company; this allocation of stock interest to the individual employee or agent, is in a parallel payment fashion and represents a new and independent way of compensation for those company employees and hence does not factor into any of their current compensation schemes; and (3) once earned and allocated for a particular professional services company employee, this stock then becomes a further inducement to retain the professional services company employee, as they would, in most instances, forfeit their various stock interests of this type if they resign their employment.
