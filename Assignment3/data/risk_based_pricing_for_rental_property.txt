Risk-based pricing for rental property . A risk-based pricing system for computing rental pricing based on the background information on an individual applicant and property-specific information is provided. Rental pricing, such as rent payments and deposits, is computed by determining a risk score corresponding to the applicant. The risk score may be based on a credit score of the applicant and rental history information of the applicant. The risk score is input to a deposit computer that determines an appropriate deposit requirement for the applicant. A property portfolio profile and a population sample set may be used to generate a property risk model, which can be used to further tailor the deposit requirement computed for a given applicant and a given property. An insurance computer can also compute an insurance premium for an insurance product associated with the applicant.
