VERIFYING WHETHER A SOFTWARE PACKAGE CALCULATING EFC USED FOR DETERMINING FEDERAL STUDENT FINANCIAL AID IS IMPLEMENTED ACCORDING TO A SPECIFICATION . A digital processing system verifies whether a software package designed to calculate EFC is implemented in compliance with a specification provided by the US Federal Government for a specific year. In one embodiment, a set of sample ISIRs provided by the US Federal Government is received, with each sample ISIR containing the details of a student and a corresponding expected set of EFC values pre-calculated based on the specification for that specific year. The digital processing system then sends the details of the student contained in a sample ISIR to the software package (being verified) and in response, receives the corresponding calculated values of the EFC calculated by the software package based on the details of the student. The calculated values of the EFC and the expected values of the EFC are then compared to determine if the software package is implemented in compliance with the specification.
