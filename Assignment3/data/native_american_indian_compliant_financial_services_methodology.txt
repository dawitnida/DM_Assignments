Native American Indian Compliant Financial Services Methodology . A financial services method formulated in accordance with the principles of the current invention supports the implementation of certain Native American Indian compliant financial instruments that are beneficial for trading and possess like qualities to those traded on traditional markets. A financial association is created under which the parties in the system take on several financial responsibilities in high-quality financial offerings. The financial services system will provide an institutional mechanism for the worldwide implementation of Native American Indian guiding principles and policies as policed by a centralized Native American Indian Compliance Office, a Native American Indian auditing and supervising organization. Such a Native American Indian compliant financial structure would prohibit the imposition of foreign levies on activities on Native American Indian sovereign lands, thus enabling the successful implementation of an operational mechanism possessing a pecuniary effect similar to traditional fiscal products that would regularly be precluded under Native American Indian financial guiding principles. Such a method will spawn the maturity of a centralized worldwide Native American Indian financial marketplace purposefully formulated with respect to the monetary services requirements of the participating financial services organizations in bringing financial opportunities to the Native American Indian investment economy for placement.
