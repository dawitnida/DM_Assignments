SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CALCULATING RECOMMENDED CHARGE LIMITS . The invention facilitates the compilation of client-imposed charge or credit limit reports based on declined purchase and/or payment transactions. The invention provides a system and method by which an account manager for a financial institution and/or a client program administrator company may perform analysis of spending patterns for cardmembers in order to determine an optimal client-imposed credit limit in order to reduce the occurrences of declined charge or credit transactions. An account manager for a financial institution and/or a client program administrator may use the limits report to persuade a cardmember to increase the client-imposed credit limit to a recommended level, thereby reducing the cardmember's inconvenience cased by declined purchase transactions while recapturing lost revenues by the card issuer also resulting from declined purchase transactions.
