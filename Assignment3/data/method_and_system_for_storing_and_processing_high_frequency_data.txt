Method and system for storing and processing high-frequency data . High-frequency financial data analysis has significantly stressed current time series database implementations because of regularly requiring the request of tens of millions of irregularly spaced data points. In addition, describing the data in these systems makes it difficult for researchers to use. The present invention includes a method and system for storing and processing high frequency data. It also includes a language for the storage and query of the data.
