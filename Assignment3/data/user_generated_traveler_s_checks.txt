User-generated traveler's checks . A system and method for issuing traveler's checks at a user's home or business using the purchaser's own computer system to allow the user to obtain traveler's checks at any time, in any denominations and without having to travel to an issuer location. User information, including a user identifier and a quantity and face value of bearer notes to be issued, are received from a user at an issuer central controller. The issuer central controller generates at least one code for generating the bearer notes and transmits the code to the user. Bearer notes including the code are then generated. Preferably, the user has registered with the note issuer prior to issuance of the notes. During registration, information relating to the user, such as identifying information and an account identifier are received from the user and stored in a database. A user identifier is transmitted to the user.
