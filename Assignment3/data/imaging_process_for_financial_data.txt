Imaging process for financial data . An imaging system, including a visualisation module for generating image display data representing at least one three-dimensional object at the origin of a spatial coordinate system, the dimensions and colour of each object being determined on the basis of financial data for a corresponding financial product. The colour of each object represents a measure of risk for the corresponding financial product, which can include a stock or a managed fund. The dimensions of each object representing a stock correspond to price to earnings ratio, dividend yield, and growth in earnings per share for the corresponding stock. The dimensions of each object representing a fund correspond to measures of financial return over respective periods of time for the corresponding fund. However, a user of the system can associate different financial parameters or measures with the object dimensions and colour as desired.
