System for automatically generating a list of merchants in conjunction with the generation of gift certificate . The automated gift certificate generation system enables the user to manually input data indicative of the gift certificate recipient, or simply download an entry from an address book, to the automated gift certificate generation system. The automated gift certificate generation system uses the gift certificate recipient data to identify merchants that are located in the vicinity of the gift certificate recipient. This process can optionally include using recipient profile data that identifies the interests and/or preferences of the gift certificate recipient. The automated gift certificate generation system automatically produces a list of available merchants that satisfy the selection parameters of the user, including proximity to the gift certificate recipient. The user can then select one or more of the merchants from this list and the automated gift certificate generation system produces a customized gift certificate addressed to the gift certificate recipient. In addition, the automated gift certificate generation system can also produce a map that provides the gift certificate recipient with directions to the merchant's store location from the gift certificate recipient's address.
