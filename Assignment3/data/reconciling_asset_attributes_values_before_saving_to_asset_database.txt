Reconciling Asset Attributes Values Before Saving to Asset Database . Discrepancies between two sets of asset information for an organization are identified and reconciled before saving to a database. One set of asset information may be compiled using automatic physical discovery software while the other set is from a financial system of the organization. After discrepancies are identified, the user may review the differences and make changes before saving. The process may be performed in real time or in batch.
