Method and Apparatus for Determining Personal Qualified Dividend Income and Generating Information Statements Thereof . Personal qualified dividend income (QDI) is calculated for one or more investors for mutual fund dividend distributions made to accounts of the investors from one or more mutual funds. A first database stores account transaction history data of the investors for each of the mutual funds. A second database stores dividend distribution information for each of the mutual funds and information indicating what percentage of dividend distributions of each of the mutual funds are QDI. A QDI calculation engine receives and processes the account transaction history data, the dividend distribution information, and the percentage of mutual fund dividend distributions that are QDI from the first and second databases to automatically determine the personal QDI for a selected time frame for one or more of the investors. The account transaction history data is used to provide transaction data for a specific investor and to determine whether holding period requirements are met for a specific investor. Personal QDI information may be automatically generated and provided to investors. A similar process may be performed for brokerage accounts that hold individual stocks.
